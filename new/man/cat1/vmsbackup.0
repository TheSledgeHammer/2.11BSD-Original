NAME
     vmsbackup - read a VMS backup tape

SYNOPSIS
     vmsbackup -{tx}[cdenvw][s setnumber][f tapefile] [ name ...
     ]

DESCRIPTION
     _v_m_s_b_a_c_k_u_p reads a VMS generated backup tape, converting the
     files to Unix format and writing the files to disc.  The
     default operation of the program is to go through an entire
     tape, extracting every file and writing it to disc.  This
     may be modified by the following options.

     c	     Use complete filenames, including the version
	     number.  A colon and the octal version number will
	     be appended to all filenames.  A colon, rather than
	     a semicolon, is used since the Unix Shell uses the
	     semicolon as the line separator.  Using a colon
	     prevents the user from having to escape the semi-
	     colon when referencing the filename.  This option is
	     useful only when multiple versions of the same file
	     are on a single tape or when a file of the same name
	     already exists in the destination directory.  The
	     default is to ignore version numbers.

     d	     use the directory structure from VMS, the default
	     value is off.

     e	     Process all filename extensions.  Since this program
	     is mainly intended to move source code and possibly
	     data from a DEC system to a Unix system, the default
	     is to ignore all files whose filename extension
	     specifies system dependent data.  The file types
	     which will be ignored, unless the e option is speci-
	     fied, are

	       exe     VMS executable file
	       lib     VMS object library file
	       obj     RSX object file
	       odl     RSX overlay description file
	       olb     RSX object library file
	       pmd     RSX post mortem dump file
	       stb     RSX task symbol table file
	       sys     RSX bootable system file
	       tsk     RSX executable task file

     f	     Use the next argument in the command line as the
	     tape device to be used, rather than the default.

	     If vmsbackup is compiled with the remote tape option
	     and the file name has the form

	     _s_y_s_t_e_m[._u_s_e_r]:/dev/???  _v_m_s_b_a_c_k_u_p will use the tape
	     drive /dev/??? on the remote system _s_y_s_t_e_m, via
	     _r_s_h(1), and _r_m_t(8).  The optional _u_s_e_r portion of
	     the pathname specifies the login name to use on the
	     remote system.  If it is not supplied, the current
	     user's login name will be used.  In all the cases,
	     the user must have the appropriate permissions on
	     the remote machine, in order to use this facility.
	     The default is /_d_e_v/_r_m_t_8 (drive 0, raw mode, 1600
	     bpi).  This must be a raw mode tape device.

     n	     If the tape has a variable-length record format,
	     then do not append a newline onto the end of the
	     records.  This option does not affect stream or FOR-
	     TRAN files.

     s saveset
	     Process only the given saveset number.

     t	     Produce a table of contents (a directory listing) on
	     the standard output of the files on tape.

     v	     Verbose output.  Normally _v_m_s_b_a_c_k_u_p does its work
	     silently.	The verbose option will cause the
	     filenames of the files being read from tape to disk
	     to be output on the standard output.

     w	     _v_m_s_b_a_c_k_u_p prints the action to be taken followed by
	     file name, then wait for user confirmation. If a
	     word beginning with `y' is given, the action is
	     done. Any other input means don't do it.

     x	     extract the named files from the tape.

     The optional
	     _n_a_m_e argument specifies one or more filenames to be
	     searched for specifically on the tape and only those
	     files are to be processed.  The name may contain the
	     usal sh(1) meta-characters *?![] 0n.

FILES
     /dev/rmt_x

BUGS
     The filename match uses the complete VMS file names.
