NAME
     sccstorcs - build RCS file from SCCS file

SYNOPSIS
     sccstorcs [-t] [-v] _s._f_i_l_e ...

DESCRIPTION
     _S_c_c_s_t_o_r_c_s builds an RCS file from each SCCS file argument.
     The deltas and comments for each delta are preserved and
     installed into the new RCS file in order.	Also preserved
     are the user access list and descriptive text, if any, from
     the SCCS file.

     The following flags are meaningful:

     -t   Trace only.  Prints detailed information about the SCCS
	  file and lists the commands that would be executed to
	  produce the RCS file.  No commands are actually exe-
	  cuted and no RCS file is made.

     -v   Verbose.  Prints each command that is run while it is
	  building the RCS file.

FILES
     For each s._s_o_m_e_f_i_l_e, _S_c_c_s_t_o_r_c_s writes the files _s_o_m_e_f_i_l_e and
     _s_o_m_e_f_i_l_e,v which should not already exist.  _S_c_c_s_t_o_r_c_s will
     abort, rather than overwrite those files if they do exist.

DIAGNOSTICS
     All diagnostics are written to stderr.  Non-zero exit status
     on error.

BUGS
     _S_c_c_s_t_o_r_c_s does not preserve all SCCS options specified in
     the SCCS file.  Most notably, it does not preserve removed
     deltas, MR numbers, and cutoff points.
