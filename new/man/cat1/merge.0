NAME
     merge - three-way file merge

SYNOPSIS
     merge [ -p ] file1 file2 file3

DESCRIPTION
     _M_e_r_g_e incorporates all changes that lead from _f_i_l_e_2 to _f_i_l_e_3
     into _f_i_l_e_1. The result goes to std. output if -p is present,
     into _f_i_l_e_1 otherwise. _M_e_r_g_e is useful for combining separate
     changes to an original. Suppose _f_i_l_e_2 is the original, and
     both _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_3 are modifications of _f_i_l_e_2. Then _m_e_r_g_e
     combines both changes.

     An overlap occurs if both _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_3 have changes in a
     common segment of lines.  _M_e_r_g_e prints how many overlaps
     occurred, and includes both alternatives in the result. The
     alternatives are delimited as follows:

	     <<<<<<< file1
	     lines in file1
	     =======
	     lines in file3
	     >>>>>>> file3

     If there are overlaps, the user should edit the result and
     delete one of the alternatives.
