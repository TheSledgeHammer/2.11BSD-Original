NAME
     rcsdiff - compare RCS revisions

SYNOPSIS
     rcsdiff [ -biwt ] [ -cefhn ] [ -r_r_e_v_1 ] [ -r_r_e_v_2 ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _R_c_s_d_i_f_f runs _d_i_f_f (1) to compare two revisions of each RCS
     file given.  A file name ending in ',v' is an RCS file name,
     otherwise a working file name. _R_c_s_d_i_f_f derives the working
     file name from the RCS file name and vice versa, as
     explained in _c_o (1). Pairs consisting of both an RCS and a
     working file name may also be specified.

     All options except -r have the same effect as described in
     _d_i_f_f(1).

     If both _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 are omitted, _r_c_s_d_i_f_f compares the
     latest revision on the trunk with the contents of the
     corresponding working file. This is useful for determining
     what you changed since the last checkin.

     If _r_e_v_1 is given, but _r_e_v_2 is omitted, _r_c_s_d_i_f_f compares
     revision _r_e_v_1 of the RCS file with the contents of the
     corresponding working file.

     If both _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 are given, _r_c_s_d_i_f_f compares revisions
     _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 of the RCS file.

     Both _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 may be given numerically or symbolically.

EXAMPLES
     The command

	     rcsdiff  f.c

     runs _d_i_f_f on the latest trunk revision of RCS file f.c,v and
     the contents of working file f.c.
