NAME
     m11 - Macro-11 assembler for UNIX

SYNOPSIS
     m11 [ option1 option2 ...	] file1 file2 ...  filen

DESCRIPTION
     _M_1_1 assembles the concatenation of the specified files
     (_f_i_l_e_1, etc.) and terminates when an ``.end'' statement is
     encountered.  The resulting object file is usually named
     _f_i_l_e_n._o_b_j (see below).  If a file argument, _f_i_l_e_i does not
     contain a ``.'' in its name, the file _f_i_l_e_i._m_1_1 will be
     sought before _f_i_l_e_i itself.


     Options, if desired, may appear anywhere in the command, and
     are chosen from the following list.  All options are inter-
     preted before any files are read.


     -ls  Produce an assembly listing and place in _f_i_l_e_n.lst

     -lt  Produce an assembly listing on the standard output.

     -fl  If coupled with the -_l_s or -_l_t directives, makes the
	  listing have a shortened format.  It is shorthand for
	  -_n_l:_s_e_q:_l_o_c:_b_i_n:_b_e_x:_m_e:_m_e_b:_t_t_m:_t_o_c:_s_y_m.

     -uc  Simulate an initial ._d_s_a_b_l _l_c directive.  Force all
	  characters in macro definitions to be upper case.  This
	  flag makes lower-case handling in _m_1_1 compatable with
	  the DEC Macro-11 assemblers.

     -um  Force all characters in macro definitions to be upper
	  case.  This flag makes lower-case handling in this
	  release of _m_1_1 compatable with previous versions of
	  _m_1_1.

     -de  Make all option choices needed to make assembly mimic
	  DEC Macro-11.  Implies (_i_n_t_e_r _a_l_i_a) the -_u_c flag.  This
	  includes the Johns Hopkins _a_s_m assembler.

     -ha  Make all option choices needed to make assembly mimic
	  earlier (Harvard) releases of m11.  This implies the
	  -_u_m flag.  Default .psect and .csect attributes are set
	  up in the funny Harvard way.

     -mx  Produce a listing of the source program as it appears
	  _a_f_t_e_r macro expansion.  Macro calls, conditional direc-
	  tives and so on appear in the listing as comments.
	  Listing appears on standard output. No machine code is
	  generated or listed.	This option is meant to

	  correspond to the -E or -P options of the C compiler
	  _c_c(_1).

     -my  Like -_m_x, except that macro calls and conditional
	  directives do not show up in the listing.

     -10  Generate an error whenever op codes not in the PDP-11
	  ``standard instruction set'' are encountered.  Program-
	  mers writing for a PDP 11/10 can catch instructions
	  illegal for that machine by using this argument.

     -dp:args
	  The default attributes for a ._p_s_e_c_t or unnamed ._c_s_e_c_t
	  are redefined, using	the colon-separated list _a_r_g_s of
	  valid .psect attributes.

     -da:args
	  The default attributes for an ._a_s_e_c_t are redefined.

     -dp:c
	  The default attributes for a named ._c_s_e_c_t are rede-
	  fined.

     -li:arglist
	  Simulate an initial ._l_i_s_t _a_r_g_l_i_s_t directive.	All ._l_i_s_t
	  and ._n_l_i_s_t directives in the program text which attempt
	  to change the settings established with the -_l_i flag
	  will be ignored.

     -nl:arglist
	  Like -_l_i:_a_r_g_l_i_s_t, but for the ._n_l_i_s_t directive.

     -en:arglist
	  Similarly, for the ._e_n_a_b_l directive.

     -ds:arglist
	  Similarly, but for the ._d_s_a_b_l directive.

     -cr:arglist
	  Produces a cross-reference listing.  If the -_l_s option
	  is also included, the cross-reference listing will fol-
	  low the assembly listing in _f_i_l_e_n.lst.  References
	  which are tagged with the symbol # are definitions.
	  References tagged with * are destuctive references: the
	  value of the symbol or variable in question is changed.
	  _A_r_g_l_i_s_t consists of colon-separated keywords from the
	  following set.  The keywords may be prefix abbreviated:

	  sym  All user-defined symbols are indexed.

	  mac  All macro names are indexed.

M11(1)		    UNIX Programmer's Manual		   M11(1)



	  per  All uses of permanent symbols - op codes, direc-
	       tives, etc - are indexed.

	  pse  All psect names are indexed.  For compatability
	       with the RT-11 _C_R_E_F program, the argument _c_s_e is
	       synonymous with _p_s_e.

	  err  All errors are indexed.

	  reg  All register uses are indexed.

	  If no _a_r_g_l_i_s_t is specified the default _s_y_m:_m_a_c:_e_r_r is
	  used.  In the listing page and line numbers for uses of
	  symbols are followed by a # sign if the symbol is
	  defined and by a * sign if the symbol is modified.

     -lp  Same as -ls, but also spools _f_i_l_e_n.lst for printing
	  upon completion.

     -no  No object file is produced.  This is useful for syntax
	  checking or list producing.

     -xs:n
	  Allots nK words of extra space for symbol table and
	  macro storage.  NOTE: This option is currently inopera-
	  tive: _m_1_1 automatically allots core for its tables as
	  needed.

     -xx  Debug flag: generate all kinds of wierd hack flack.

     -ns  No symbol table is included in the object file (thus
	  ddt knows of no symbols from this assembly).

     -sx  Make the symbol table contain ``local symbols'' as well
	  as ordinary symbols.

     -u   Treat form feed characters as spaces.  This will make
	  _m_1_1's idea of line numbers coincide with the UNIX text
	  editors.  Macro-11 statements containing imbedded form
	  feed characters will be parsed differently when the -_u
	  flag is in effect.

     -na:file
	  Override the convention of using last name as file
	  name.  Instead, use names _f_i_l_e._o_b_j and _f_i_l_e._l_s_t for
	  object and listing files.

NOTES
     This implementation of Macro-11 is a distant hand-me down
     from an old DEC Macro-11 modified at Harvard University in
     the early 1970's.	It is grubby with smudges by Brent Byer,
     F. J. Howard, Bob Bowering, and Jim Reeds.  It does not

     implement keyword arguments such as are described in section
     7.3.6 of the DEC manual.  The .enabl abs option does not
     work.  Listing control is by default .list ttm.  Unlike ear-
     lier editions of m11 at UCB and at Harvard, it does treat
     immediate constants of floating point operations correctly:
     see the last paragraph of section 6.4.2 on the middle of
     page 6-27 of the DEC manual.  M11 has several directives not
     described in the DEC manual.  See the _N_e_w _U_C_B _M_1_1 _M_a_n_u_a_l.
     The default attributes for ._p_s_e_c_t_s are different from those
     described in the DEC manual, but may be changed by the -_d_p
     flag.  The ._e_n_a_b_l _g_l_b feature is implemented: undefined sym-
     bols are taken as undefined global externals.
