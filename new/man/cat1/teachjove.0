TEACHJOVE(1)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	     TEACHJOVE(1)



NAME
     TEACHJOVE - learn how to use the JOVE editor

SYNOPSIS
     teachjove

DESCRIPTION
     TEACHJOVE is a simple program that calls up the JOVE  editor
     on  a  special  file that is an interactive tutorial for the
     JOVE editor.  Once in JOVE all you do is follow the instruc-
     tions  and by doing so you will learn all about JOVE!  NOTE:
     TEACHJOVE actually makes a copy of the tutorial in your home
     directory;  if you ever want to start over (if you trash the
     file by accident) all you need to	do  is	remove	the  file
     "~/teach-jove" and run teachjove again.

FILES
     /usr/new/lib/jove/teach-jove -- THE special file.

SEE ALSO
