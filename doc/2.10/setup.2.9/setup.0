This document contains instructions for installation and operation of the

2.9BSD release of the PDP-11\(dg

It is adapted from the paper

by Bill Joy.

This document explains the procedures for installation of
Berkeley UNIX on a PDP-11
or to upgrade an existing Berkeley PDP-11 UNIX system to the new release.
It then explains how to configure the kernel for the available devices
and user load, lay out file systems on the available disks,
set up terminal lines and user accounts, and do system specific tailoring.
It also explains system operations procedures: shutdown and startup,
hardware error reporting and diagnosis, file system backup procedures,
resource control, performance monitoring, and procedures for recompiling
and reinstalling system software.
Technical details on the kernel changes are presented in the accompanying paper,
``Changes in the Kernel in 2.9BSD.''

The 2.9BSD release, unlike previous versions of the Second Berkeley
Software Distribution, is a complete Version 7 UNIX system with
all of the standard UNIX tools and utilities, with or without Berkeley
modifications.
Therefore, it does not need to be layered onto an existing Version 7 system;
because of the many changes and additions throughout the system,
it would require a substantial effort to merge into most earlier systems.
