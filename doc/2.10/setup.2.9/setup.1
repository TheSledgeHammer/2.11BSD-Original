This document explains how to install the 2.9BSD release of the Berkeley
version of UNIX for the PDP-11 on your system.  If you are running the
July 1981 release of the system, which was called 2.8BSD, you can avoid
a full bootstrap from
the new tape by extracting only the software that has changed.
Be warned, however, that there are a large number of changes.
Unless you have many local modifications
it will probably be easier to bring up an intact 2.9BSD system
and merge your local changes into it.
If you are running any other version of UNIX on your
PDP-11, you will have to do a full bootstrap.
This means dumping all file systems which are to be retained
onto tape in a format that can be read in again later (\fItar\fP
format is best, or V7 \fIdump\fP if the file system configuration
will be the same).
A new root file system can be made and read in using
standalone utilites on the tape.
The system sources and the rest of the /usr file system
can then be extracted.
Finally, old file systems can be reloaded from tape.
.PP
To get an overview of the process and an idea
of some of the alternative strategies that are available,
it is wise to look through all of these instructions before
beginning.

.NH 2
Distribution format
.PP
The distribution format is two 9-track 800bpi 2400' magnetic tapes.
The tapes are also available at 1600bpi.  The format for 1600bpi tapes
is the same.
If you are able to do so,
it is a good idea to immediately copy the
tapes in the distribution kit to guard against disaster.
The first tape contains some 512-byte records,
some 1024-byte records, followed by many 10240-byte records.
There are interspersed tape marks; end-of-tape is signaled
by a double end-of-file.
The second tape contains only 10240-byte records
with no interspersed tape marks.
.PP
The boot tape contains several standalone utility programs,
a \fIdump\fP image of a root file system, and a \fItar\fP image
of part of the /usr file system.
The files on this tape are:

The last file on the tape is a \fItar\fP image of most of the /usr file
system except for sources (relative to /usr; see \fItar\fP\|(1)).
It contains most of the binaries and other material
which is normally kept on-line,
with the following directories:
\fB70 adm bin contrib dict doc games include lib local man
msgs preserve public spool sys tmp ucb\fP.
.\"CHECK
It contains 1594 10K byte blocks.
The second tape contains one file in \fItar\fP format, again relative to /usr,
.\"CHECK
consisting of 1958 10K byte blocks and
containing the source
tree with all command and kernel sources.
It contains the directories \fBnet\fP,
\fBsrc\fP, and \fBingres\fP and includes the Berkeley
additions (which are in /usr/src/ucb and /usr/ingres).
The \fBnet\fP directory contains sources for the TCP/IP system.
.NH 2
UNIX device naming
.PP
UNIX has a set of names for devices that are different
from the DEC names for the devices.
The disk and tape names used by the bootstrap and the system are:
.DS
.TS
l l.
RK05 disks	\fBrk\fP
RK06, RK07 disks	\fBhk\fP
RL01, RL02 disks	\fBrl\fP
RP02, RP03 disks	\fBrp\fP
TE16, TU45, TU77/TM02, 3 tapes	\fBht\fP
TE10/TM11 tapes	\fBtm\fP
TS11 tapes	\fBts\fP
.TE
.DE
.PP
There is also a generic disk driver, \fBxp\fP, that will handle
most types of SMD disks on one or more controllers
(even different types on the same controller).
The \fBxp\fP driver handles RM02, RM03, RM05, RP04, RP05 and  RP06
disks on DEC, Emulex, and Diva UNIBUS or MASSBUS controllers.
.PP
The standalone system used to bootstrap the full UNIX system
uses device names of the form:
.DS
\fIxx\|\fP(\fIy\fP,\fIz\fP)
.DE
where \fIxx\fP is one of \fBhk\fP, \fBht\fP, \fBrk\fP, \fBrl\fP,
\fBrp\fP, \fBtm\fP, \fBts\fP, or \fBxp\fP.  The value \fIy\fP
specifies the device or drive unit to use.
The \fIz\fP
value is interpreted differently for tapes and disks:
for disks it is a block offset for a file system
and for tapes it is a file number on the tape.
.PP
Large UNIX physical disks (\fBhk\fP, \fBrp\fP, \fBxp\fP) are divided into 8
logical disk partitions, each of which may occupy any
consecutive cylinder range on the physical device.
The cylinders occupied by the 8 partitions for each drive type
are specified in section 4 of the Berkeley PDP-11
\s-2UNIX\s0
Programmer's manual.\(dg
.FS
\u\(dg\dIt is possible to change the partitions
by changing the values in the disk's sizes array in ioconf.c.
.FE
Each partition may be used
for either a raw data area such as a swapping area or to store a
UNIX file system.
It is conventional for the first partition on a disk to be used
to store a root file system, from which UNIX may be bootstrapped.
The second partition is traditionally used as a swapping area, and the
rest of the disk is divided into spaces for additional ``mounted
file systems'' by use of one or more additional partitions.
.PP
The disk partitions have names in the standalone system of the form
``\fIxx\|\fP(\fIy\fP,\fIz\fP)'' as described above.  Thus partition
1 of an RK07 at drive 0 would be ``hk(0,5940)''.
When not running
standalone, this partition would normally be available as ``/dev/hk0b''.
Here the prefix ``/dev'' is the name of the directory where all
``special files'' normally live, the ``hk'' serves an obvious purpose,
the ``0'' identifies this as a partition of hk drive number ``0''
and the ``b'' identifies this as partition 1 (where we number
from 0, the 0th partition being ``hk0a'').
Finally, ``5940'' is the sector offset to partition 1, as determined
from the manual page
.IR hk (4).
.PP
Returning to the discussion of the standalone system, we recall
that tapes also took two integer parameters.  In the case of a
TE16/TU tape formatter on drive 0, the
files on the tape have names ``ht(0,0)'', ``ht(0,1)'', etc.
Here ``file'' means a tape file containing a single data stream
separated by a single tape mark.
The distribution tapes have data structures in the tape
files and though the first tape contains only 8 tape files, it contains
several thousand UNIX files.
.NH 2
UNIX devices: block and raw
.PP
UNIX makes a distinction between ``block'' and ``character'' (raw)
devices.  Each disk has a block device interface where
the system makes the device byte addressable and you can write
a single byte in the middle of the disk.  The system will read
out the data from the disk sector, insert the byte you gave it
and put the modified data back.  The disks with the names
``/dev/\fIxx\^\fP0a'', etc. are block devices and thus use
the system's normal buffering mechanism.
There are also raw devices available, which do physical I/O operations
directly from the program's data area.
These have names like ``/dev/r\fIxx\^\fP0a'', the
``r'' here standing for ``raw.''  In the bootstrap procedures we
will often suggest using the raw devices, because these tend
to work faster.  In general, however, the block
devices are used.  They are where file systems are ``mounted.''
The UNIX name space is increased by logically associating (\fImount\fP\|ing)
a UNIX file system residing on a given block device with a directory
in the current name space.  See \fImount\fP\|(2) and \fImount\fP\|(8).
This association is severed by \fIumount\fP.
.PP
You should be aware that it is sometimes important to use
the character device (for efficiency) or not (because it wouldn't
work, e.g. to write a single byte in the middle of a sector).
Don't change the instructions by using the wrong type of device
indiscriminately.
