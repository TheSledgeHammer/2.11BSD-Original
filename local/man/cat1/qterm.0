NAME
     qterm - Query Terminal

SYNOPSIS
     qterm [ +|-alt ] [ +|-always ] [ +|-longname ] [ +|-quiet ]
     [ +|-sent ] [ +|-timeout ] [ +|-usrtab ] [ +|-watch ] [
     +|-systab ] [ -wait _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l ] [ -file _t_a_b_f_i_l_e ]

DESCRIPTION
     _Q_t_e_r_m is used to query a terminal to determine its name.
     This is done by sending a special sequence to the terminal,
     reading in a response, and comparing it against a table of
     possible responses.  The ``name'' printed to standard output
     should be one found in the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(_5) (or _t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o(_5) for
     System V systems) database.

     For _c_s_h(_1) users, putting a line in your ._l_o_g_i_n file such
     as:

	  setenv TERM `qterm`

     should automagically set your terminal type.  For _s_h(_1)
     users, putting these lines in your ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e file should set
     your terminal type:

	  TERM=`qterm`
	  export TERM


     By default, qterm uses the system tab file
     /_u_s_r/_l_o_c_a_l/_l_i_b/_q_t_e_r_m_t_a_b to obtain information for querying
     terminals.

OPTIONS
     +alt Use the alternate string ``<ESCAPE>[c'' when asking the
	  terminal to identify itself.	This string is recognized
	  by most ANSI compatible terminals.

     -alt Don't use the alternate string, but the string found in
	  the tabfile being used.  This is the default.

     +always
	  Always send the terminal query string.  Normally the
	  query string is only sent if it differs from the last
	  string sent.

     -always
	  Only send the terminal query string if it differs from
	  the last string sent.  This is the default.

     -file _t_a_b_f_i_l_e
	  Use <_t_a_b_f_i_l_e> to find information for querying the

	  terminal.

     +longname
	  Print only the long (verbose) terminal name.

     -longname
	  Don't print the long (verbose) terminal name.  This is
	  the default.

     +quiet
	  Be quiet and only print the terminal name to standard
	  output.

     -quiet
	  Don't be quiet and only print the terminal name to
	  standard output.  This is the default.

     +watch
	  Watch the characters sent and recieved to the terminal.

     -watch
	  Don't watch the characters sent and recieved to the
	  terminal.  This is the default.

     +timeout
	  Wait for timeout when listening for response string.
	  This is useful if the first entry in a qtermtab doesn't
	  have a response string with an ending character that is
	  common with the rest of the qtermtab entries.

     -timeout
	  Disable waiting for timeout when listening for response
	  string.  This is the default.

     +usrtab
	  Use $HOME/.qtermtab to find information for querying
	  the terminal.

     -usrtab
	  Don't use $HOME/.qtermtab to find information for
	  querying the terminal.  This is the default.

     +sent
	  Display the final response sent from the terminal in a
	  ``nice'' fashion.

     -sent
	  Don't display the final response sent from the termi-
	  nal.	This is the default.

     +systab
	  Use /usr/local/lib/qtermtab to find information for

	  querying the terminal.  This is the default

     -systab
	  Don't use system tab file to find information for
	  querying the terminal.

     -wait _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l
	  Set the wait (timeout) period to _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l (in seconds).

QTERMTAB
     The format of the file $HOME/.qtermtab and _q_t_e_r_m'_s system
     tab file /_u_s_r/_l_o_c_a_l/_l_i_b/_q_t_e_r_m_t_a_b, consists of four fields
     each seperated by white space (tabs and/or spaces).  The
     first field is the string that should be used to query the
     terminal.	The second field is the string to expect in
     response to the query.  The third field is the terminal name
     (compatible with _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(_5)) to print to standard output.
     The fourth field is optional and may contain a description
     of the exact manufacturer and model name of the terminal to
     be used in a message printed to standard error.

     Blank lines or lines starting with the character ``#'' are
     ignored and may be used as comment lines.	A character pre-
     ceeded by a ``^'' is taken to mean the _c_o_n_t_r_o_l character.
     (i.e. ``^['' is interpretted as an <ESCAPE>).  Both the send
     and receive (first and second) fields may contain octal
     values preceeded by a `\'.  (i.e. <ESCAPE> can be
     represented by `\033'.)

     The ``expect'' (second) field can be a regular expression
     denoted by a leading backslash (`\').  i.e. "^[[123" matches
     the string "^[[123", whereas "^[\[123]" matches "^[1" or
     "^[2" or "^[3".  See _e_d(_1) for regular expression informa-
     tion.

	  _Q_T_e_r_m did not receive a response from the terminal, or
	  the response did not match any that _q_t_e_r_m has stored
	  internally.  Use the +watch option to check to see
	  which is the case.

BUGS
     Many terminals do not send a response at all.
