NAME
     mdir - display an MSDOS directory

SYNOPSIS
     mdir [ -w ] msdosdirectory

     mdir [ -w ] msdosfile [ msdosfiles...  ]

DESCRIPTION
     _M_d_i_r displays the contents of an MSDOS directory.

     _M_d_i_r will allow the following command line option:

     w    Wide output.  This option will print the filenames
          across the page without displaying the file size or
          creation date.

     An error occurs if a component of the path is not a direc-
     tory.

     MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
     or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
     will require the names to be enclosed in quotes to protect
     them from the shell.

     The _m_c_d command may be used to establish the device and the
     current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
     default is A:/.

BUGS
     Allows multiple arguments, which does not follow the MSDOS
     convention.

     There is no /P (pause) option.
