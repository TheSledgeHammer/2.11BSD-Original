NAME
     mkmanifest - create a shell script to restore Unix filenames

SYNOPSIS
     mkmanifest [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
     _M_k_m_a_n_i_f_e_s_t creates a shell script that will aid in the res-
     toration of Unix filenames that got clobbered by the MSDOS
     filename restrictions.  MSDOS filenames are restricted to 8
     character names, 3 character extensions, upper case only, no
     device names, and no illegal characters.

     The mkmanifest program is compatible with the methods used
     in _p_c_o_m_m, _a_r_c, and _m_t_o_o_l_s to change perfectly good Unix
     filenames to fit the MSDOS restrictions.

EXAMPLE
     I want to copy the following Unix files to a MSDOS diskette
     (using the _m_c_o_p_y command).

          very_long_name
          2.many.dots
          illegal:
          good.c
          prn.dev
          Capital

     _M_c_o_p_y will convert the names to:

          very_lon
          2xmany.dot
          illegalx
          good.c
          xprn.dev
          capital

     The command:

     mkmanifest very_long_name 2.many.dots illegal: good.c
     prn.dev Capital > manifest

     would produce the following:

          mv very_lon very_long_name
          mv 2xmany.dot 2.many.dots
          mv illegalx illegal:
          mv xprn.dev prn.dev
          mv capital Capital

     Notice that "good.c" did not require any conversion, so it
     did not appear in the output.

MKMANIFEST(1)       UNIX Programmer's Manual        MKMANIFEST(1)



     Suppose I've copied these files from the diskette to another
     Unix system, and I now want the files back to their original
     names.  If the file "manifest" (the output captured above)
     was sent along with those files, it could be used to convert
     the filenames.
