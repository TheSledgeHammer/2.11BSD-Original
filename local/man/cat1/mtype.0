MTYPE(1)            UNIX Programmer's Manual             MTYPE(1)



NAME
     mtype - display contents of an MSDOS file

SYNOPSIS
     mtype [ -ts ] msdosfile [ msdosfiles... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _M_t_y_p_e displays the specified MSDOS file on the screen.

     _M_t_y_p_e will allow the following command line options:

     t    Text file viewing.  _M_t_y_p_e will translate incoming car-
          riage return/line feeds to line feeds.

     s    Strip high bit.  _M_t_y_p_e will strip the high bit from the
          data.

     MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
     or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
     will require the names to be enclosed in quotes to protect
     them from the shell.

     The _m_c_d command may be used to establish the device and the
     current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
     default is A:/.

SEE ALSO
     mcd(1), mread(1)

BUGS
     Allows multiple arguments, which does not follow the MSDOS
     convention.
