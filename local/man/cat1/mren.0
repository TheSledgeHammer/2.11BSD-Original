NAME
     mren - rename an existing MSDOS file

SYNOPSIS
     mren [ -v ] sourcefile targetfile

DESCRIPTION
     _M_r_e_n renames an existing file on an MSDOS filesystem.

     _M_r_e_n will allow the following command line option:

     v    Verbose mode.  Display the new filename if the name
          supplied is invalid.

     Reasonable care is taken to create a valid MSDOS filename.
     If an invalid MSDOS target name is specified, _m_r_e_n will
     change the name (and prompt the user to accept or reject the
     new name if the verbose mode is set).

     The path component of the target filename (if supplied) is
     ignored.  In other words, you may not use _m_r_e_n to move a
     file from one subdirectory to another.

     _M_r_e_n may be used to rename directories.

     MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
     or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
     will require the names to be enclosed in quotes to protect
     them from the shell.

     The _m_c_d command may be used to establish the device and the
     current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
     default is A:/.

BUGS
     MSDOS can't use REN to rename directories.
