NAME
     mcd - change MSDOS directory

SYNOPSIS
     mcd [ msdosdirectory ]

DESCRIPTION
     Without arguments, _m_c_d will report the current device and
     working directory.  Otherwise, _m_c_d changes the current dev-
     ice and current working directory relative to an MSDOS
     filesystem.

     The environmental variable MCWD may be used to locate the
     file where the device and current working directory informa-
     tion is stored.  The default is '$HOME/.mcwd'.  Information
     in this file is ignored if the file is more than 6 hours
     old.

     MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
     or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
     will require the directory name to be enclosed in quotes to
     protect it from the shell.

SEE ALSO
     mdir(1)

BUGS
     MSDOS doesn't use CD to change to another device.

     It may be wise to remove old .mcwd files at logout.
