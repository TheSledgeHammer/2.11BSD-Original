MREAD(1)            UNIX Programmer's Manual             MREAD(1)



NAME
     mread - low level read (copy) an MSDOS file to Unix

SYNOPSIS
     mread [ -tnm ] msdosfile unixfile

     mread [ -tnm ] msdosfile [ msdosfiles... ] unixdirectory

DESCRIPTION
     In the first form, _m_r_e_a_d copies the specified MSDOS file to
     the named Unix file.  The second form of the command copies
     multiple MSDOS files to the named Unix directory.

     _M_r_e_a_d will allow the following command line options:

     t    Text file transfer.  _M_r_e_a_d will translate incoming car-
          riage return/line feeds to line feeds.

     n    No warning.  _M_r_e_a_d will not warn the user when
          overwriting an existing file.

     m    Preserve the file modification times.

     If the target file already exists, and the -_n option is not
     in effect, _m_r_e_a_d asks whether or not to overwrite the file.

     MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
     or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
     will require the names to be enclosed in quotes to protect
     them from the shell.

     The _m_c_d command may be used to establish the device and the
     current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
     default is A:/.

SEE ALSO
     mcd(1), mcopy(1), mtype(1), mwrite(1)

BUGS
     Unlike MSDOS, the destination directory may not be omitted.
