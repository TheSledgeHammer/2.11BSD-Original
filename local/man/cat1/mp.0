NAME
     mp - POSTSCRIPT pretty printer

SYNOPSIS
     mp [-A4] [-C] [-F] [-PS] [-US] [-a] [-d] [-e] [-ff] [-fp]
     [-l] [-m] [-o] [-p _p_r_o_l_o_g_u_e] [-s _s_u_b_j_e_c_t] [-tm] [-ts] [-v]
     [-?] [_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e...]

DESCRIPTION
     The _m_p program reads each _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e in sequence and generates
     a prettified version of the contents in POSTSCRIPT format,
     sent to standard output.  If no filename argument is pro-
     vided, _m_p reads the standard input.  If the standard input
     is a terminal, input is terminated by an EOF signal, usually
     Ctrl-D.

     Mail items, news articles, ordinary ASCII files, complete
     mail folders, and digests are all acceptable input formats
     for _m_p.  The output format includes grayscale lozenges con-
     taining banner information at the top and bottom of every
     page.

     The program is conveniently used in conjunction with the
     print button of the SunView/_x_n_e_w_s(1) _m_a_i_l_t_o_o_l(1) programs,
     or the _p_i_p_e command provided by _m_a_i_l(1).  Add the following
     two lines to your ._m_a_i_l_r_c file:
	       set printmail='mp | lpr'
	       set cmd="mp | lpr &"

     Source the ._m_a_i_l_r_c file, and you are ready to use _m_p.  For
     printing ordinary ASCII files, the following alias (to be
     placed in your ._c_s_h_r_c file) may also prove useful:
	       alias print 'mp -o -s "\!*" <\!* | lpr'

OPTIONS
     -A4  Use A4 paper size (8.5 x 11.4 inches).

     -C   Instead of using "\nFrom" to denote the start of new
	  mail messages, mp will look for (and use) the value of
	  the Content-Length: mail header. If the Content-Length
	  doesn't take you to the next "\nFrom", then it's wrong,
	  and mp falls back to looking for the next "\nFrom" in
	  the mail folder.

     -F   Instead of printing who the mail article is for, the
	  top header will contain who the mail article is from. A
	  useful option for people with their own personal
	  printer.

     -PS  If the mail or digest message just has PostScript as
	  the text of the message, then this is normally just
	  passed straight through. Specifying this option, causes

	  PostScript to be printed as text.

     -US  Use US paper size (8.5 x 11 inches).

     -a   Format the file as a news article.  The top banner con-
	  tains the text: "Article from _n_e_w_s_g_r_o_u_p ", where _n_e_w_s_-
	  _g_r_o_u_p is the first news group found on the Newsgroups:
	  line.

     -d   Format the file as a digest.

     -e   Assume the ELM mail frontend intermediate file format.
	  Used when printing messages from within ELM (using the
	  "p" command), especially for printing tagged messages.
	  This option must be specified in your ELM option setup.

     -ff  Format the file for use with a Filofax personal
	  organiser.

     -fp  Format the file for use with a Franklin Planner per-
	  sonal organiser.

     -l   Format output in landscape mode.  Two pages of text
	  will be printed per sheet of paper.

     -m   Format the file as a mail folder, printing multiple
	  messages.

     -o   Format the file as an ordinary ASCII file.

     -p _p_r_o_l_o_g_u_e
	  Employ the file _p_r_o_l_o_g_u_e as the POSTSCRIPT prologue
	  file, overriding any previously defined file names.

     -s _s_u_b_j_e_c_t
	  Use  _s_u_b_j_e_c_t as the new subject for the printout. If
	  you are printing ordinary ASCII files which have been
	  specified on the command line, the the subject will
	  default to the name of each of these files.

     -tm  Format the file for use with the Time Manager personal
	  organiser.

     -ts  format the file for use with the Time/System Interna-
	  tional personal organiser.

     -v   Print the version number of this release of _m_p.

     -?   Print the usage line for _m_p (note that the ? character
	  must be escaped if using _c_s_h(1)).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     The _m_p prologue file is determined by first looking for the
     environment variable _M_P__P_R_O_L_O_G_U_E, which specifies the direc-
     tory where _m_p prologue files are to be found.  If
     _M_P__P_R_O_L_O_G_U_E is not found, then the default directory is
     assumed (/_u_s_r/_l_o_c_a_l/_l_i_b/_m_p/_m_p._p_r_o._p_s).
