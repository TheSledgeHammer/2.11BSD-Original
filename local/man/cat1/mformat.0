MFORMAT(1)          UNIX Programmer's Manual           MFORMAT(1)



NAME
     mformat - add an MSDOS filesystem to a low-level formatted
     diskette.

SYNOPSIS
     mformat [ -t tracks ] [ -h heads ] [ -s sectors ] [ -l
     volume label ] drive:

DESCRIPTION
     _M_f_o_r_m_a_t adds a minimal MSDOS filesystem (boot sector, FAT,
     and root directory) to a diskette that has already been for-
     matted by a Unix low-level format.

     The follow options are supported:

     t    The number of tracks (not cylinders).

     h    The number of heads (sides).

     s    The number of sectors per track.

     l    An optional volume label.

     To format a diskette at a density other than the default,
     you must supply (at least) those command line parameters
     that are different from the default.

SEE ALSO
     mlabel(1)

BUGS
     Requires a low-level format utility from Unix.

     Doesn't detect (or record) bad block information.
