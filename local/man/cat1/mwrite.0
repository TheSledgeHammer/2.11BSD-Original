MWRITE(1)           UNIX Programmer's Manual            MWRITE(1)



NAME
     mwrite - low level write (copy) a Unix file to MSDOS

SYNOPSIS
     mwrite [ -tnvm ] unixfile msdosfile

     mwrite [ -tnvm ] unixfile [ unixfiles... ] msdosdirectory

DESCRIPTION
     In the first form, _m_w_r_i_t_e copies the specified Unix file to
     the named MSDOS file.  The second form of the command copies
     multiple Unix files to the named MSDOS directory.

     _M_w_r_i_t_e will allow the following command line options:

     t    Text file transfer.  _M_w_r_i_t_e will translate incoming
          line feeds to carriage return/line feeds.

     n    No warning.  _M_w_r_i_t_e will not warn the user when
          overwriting an existing file.

     v    Verbose mode.  Display the new filename if the Unix
          filename requires conversion.

     m    Preserve the file modification times.

     If the target file already exists, and the -_n option is not
     in effect, _m_w_r_i_t_e asks whether or not to overwrite the file.

     Reasonable care is taken to create a valid MSDOS filename.
     If an invalid name is specified, _m_w_r_i_t_e will change the name
     (and display the new name if the verbose mode is set).

     MSDOS subdirectory names are are supported with either the
     '/' or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wild-
     cards will require the names to be enclosed in quotes to
     protect them from the shell.

     The _m_c_d command may be used to establish the device and the
     current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
     default is A:/.

BUGS
     Unlike MSDOS, the destination directory may not be omitted.
