NAME
     mrd - remove an MSDOS subdirectory

SYNOPSIS
     mrd msdosdirectory [ msdosdirectories... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _M_r_d removes a directory from an MSDOS filesystem.

     An error occurs if the directory is not empty.

     MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
     or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
     will require the directory name to be enclosed in quotes to
     protect it from the shell.

     The _m_c_d command may be used to establish the device and the
     current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
     default is A:/.

SEE ALSO
     mcd(1), mmd(1)

BUGS
     Allows multiple arguments, which does not follow the MSDOS
     convention.
