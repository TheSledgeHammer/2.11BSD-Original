NAME
     mmd - make an MSDOS subdirectory

SYNOPSIS
     mmd [ -v ] msdosdirectory [ msdosdirectories... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _M_m_d makes a new directory on an MSDOS filesystem.

     _M_m_d will allow the following command line option:

     v    Verbose mode.  Display the new directory name if the
          name supplied is invalid.

     Reasonable care is taken to create a valid MSDOS directory
     name.  If an invalid name is specified, _m_m_d will change the
     name (and display the new name if the verbose mode is set).

     An error occurs if the directory already exists.

     MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
     or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
     will require the directory name to be enclosed in quotes to
     protect it from the shell.

     The _m_c_d command may be used to establish the device and the
     current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
     default is A:/.

BUGS
     Allows multiple arguments, which does not follow the MSDOS
     convention.
