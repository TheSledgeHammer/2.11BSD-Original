NAME
     mdel - delete an MSDOS file

SYNOPSIS
     mdel [ -v ] msdosfile [ msdosfiles...  ]

DESCRIPTION
     _M_d_e_l deletes a file on an MSDOS filesystem.

     _M_d_e_l will allow the following command line option:

     v    Verbose mode.  Echo the filenames as they are pro-
          cessed.

     _M_d_e_l will ask for verification prior to removing a read-only
     file.

     MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
     or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
     will require the names to be enclosed in quotes to protect
     them from the shell.

     The _m_c_d command may be used to establish the device and the
     current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
     default is A:/.

BUGS
     Allows multiple arguments, which does not follow the MSDOS
     convention.
