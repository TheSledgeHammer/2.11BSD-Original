NAME
     mattrib - change MSDOS file attribute flags

SYNOPSIS
     mattrib [ -a|+a ] [ -h|+h ] [ -r|+r ] [ -s|+s ] msdosfile [
     msdosfiles... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _M_a_t_t_r_i_b will add attribute flags to an MSDOS file (with the
     '+' operator) or remove attribute flags (with the '-' opera-
     tor).

     _M_a_t_t_r_i_b will allow the following command line options:

     a    Archive bit.  Used by some backup programs to indicate
          a new file.

     r    Read-only bit.  Used to indicate a read-only file.
          Files with this bit set cannot be erased by DEL.  How-
          ever, _m_d_e_l is more cunning.

     s    System bit.  Used by MSDOS to indicate a operating sys-
          tem file.

     h    Hidden bit.  Used to make files hidden from DIR.  How-
          ever, _m_d_i_r is more cunning.

     MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
     or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
     will require the names to be enclosed in quotes to protect
     them from the shell.

     The _m_c_d command may be used to establish the device and the
     current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
     default is A:/.

BUGS
     Most versions of ATTRIB don't allow this many options.
