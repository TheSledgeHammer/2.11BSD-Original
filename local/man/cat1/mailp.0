DESCRIPTION
     _m_a_i_l_p is a frontend to the _m_p PostScript pretty printer pro-
     gram. It uses different names to provide various _m_p options:

     _m_a_i_l_p will print out mail messages.

     _n_e_w_s_p will print out USENET news articles.

     _d_i_g_e_s_t_p will print out USENET digest files.

     _f_i_l_e_p will print out ordinary ASCII files.

     _f_i_l_o_f_a_x_p will print out in Filofax personal organiser for-
     mat.

     _f_r_a_n_k_l_i_n_p will print out in Franklin Planner personal
     organiser format.

     _t_i_m_e_m_a_n_p will print out in Time Manager personal organiser
     format.

     _t_i_m_e_s_y_s_p will print out in Time/System International per-
     sonal organiser format.

     _m_a_i_l_p (and the associated programs) read each _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e in
     sequence and generate a prettified version of the contents
     in PostScript format. If no filename arguments are provided,
     _m_a_i_l_p reads the standard input.

     _m_a_i_l_p uses the PRINTER environment variable to determine
     which printer the output from the _m_p program is sent to. If
     this environment variable is not found, then it defaults to

     the _p_s printer.

OPTIONS
     -F   Instead of printing who the mail article is for, the
	  top header will contain who the mail article is from. A
	  useful option for people with their own personal
	  printer.

     -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
	  Send output to the named printer. Otherwise send output
	  to the printer named in the PRINTER environment vari-
	  able.

     -h   Banner printing is disabled. Most of the information
	  that typically appears on the banner sheet is output in
	  the _m_p banners.

     -d_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
	  Send output to the named printer. Otherwise send output
	  to the printer named in the PRINTER environment vari-
	  able.

     -l   Format output in landscape mode.  Two pages of text
	  will be printed per sheet of paper.

     -s _s_u_b_j_e_c_t
	  Use  _s_u_b_j_e_c_t as the new subject for the printout. If
	  you are printing ordinary ASCII files which have been
	  specified on the command line, the subject will default
	  to the name of each of these files.
