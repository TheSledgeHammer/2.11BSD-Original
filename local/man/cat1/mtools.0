NAME
     Mtools - a collection of tools for manipulating MSDOS files

SYNOPSIS
     mattrib - change MSDOS file attribute flags
     mcd - change MSDOS directory
     mcopy - copy MSDOS files to/from Unix
     mdel - delete an MSDOS file
     mdir - display an MSDOS directory
     mformat - add an MSDOS filesystem to a low-level formatted diskette
     mlabel - make an MSDOS volume label
     mmd - make an MSDOS subdirectory
     mrd - remove an MSDOS subdirectory
     mread - low level read (copy) an MSDOS file to Unix
     mren - rename an existing MSDOS file
     mtype - display contents of an MSDOS file
     mwrite - low level write (copy) a Unix file to MSDOS

DESCRIPTION
     Mtools is a public domain collection of programs to allow
     Unix systems to read, write, and manipulate files on an
     MSDOS filesystem (typically a diskette).  Each program
     attempts to emulate the MSDOS equivalent command as closely
     as practical.

     MSDOS filenames are optionally composed of a drive letter
     followed by a colon, a subdirectory, and a filename.  Sub-
     directory names can use either the '/' or '\' separator.
     The use of the '\' separator or wildcards will require the
     names to be enclosed in quotes to protect them from the
     shell.

     The regular expression "pattern matching" routines follow
     the Unix-style rules.  For example, '*' matches all MSDOS
     files in lieu of '*.*'.  The archive, hidden, read-only and
     system attribute bits are ignored during pattern matching.

     All options use the '-' (minus) flag, not '/' as you'd
     expect in MSDOS.

     The _m_c_d command is used to establish the device and the
     current working directory (relative to the MSDOS filesys-
     tem), otherwise the default is assumed to be A:/.

BUGS

     (when multiple disk capacities are supported) is an
