NAME
     mcopy - copy MSDOS files to/from Unix

SYNOPSIS
     mcopy [ -tnvm ] sourcefile targetfile

     mcopy [ -tnvm ] sourcefile [ sourcefiles... ] targetdirec-
     tory

DESCRIPTION
     _M_c_o_p_y copies the specified file to the named file, or copies
     multiple files to the named directory.  The source and tar-
     get can be either MSDOS or Unix files.

     The use of a drive letter designation on the MSDOS files,
     'a:' for example, determines the direction of the transfer.
     A missing drive designation implies a Unix file whose path
     starts in the current directory

     _M_c_o_p_y will allow the following command line options:

     t    Text file transfer.  _M_c_o_p_y will translate incoming car-
          riage return/line feeds to line feeds.

     n    No warning.  _M_c_o_p_y will not warn the user when
          overwriting an existing file.

     v    Verbose mode.

     m    Preserve the file modification time.

     If the target file already exists, and the -_n option is not
     in effect, _m_c_o_p_y asks whether or not to overwrite the file.

     MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
     or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
     will require the names to be enclosed in quotes to protect
     them from the shell.

     The _m_c_d command may be used to establish the device and the
     current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
     default is A:/.

SEE ALSO
     mcd(1), mread(1), mwrite(1)

BUGS
     Unlike MSDOS, the destination directory may not be omitted.

     The '+' operator (append) from MSDOS is not supported.

     No other _M_t_o_o_l_s command requires the use of a drive letter
     designation on MSDOS files.
