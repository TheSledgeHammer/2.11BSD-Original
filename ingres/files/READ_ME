.../files

This directory is roughly equivalent to /etc in UNIX.  The files
in this directory are critical for the system to run.  The important
files are:

	dayfile6.3 -- the dayfile printed out when INGRES starts
		up.
	dbtmplt6.3 -- the template for a database; this file
		drives creatdb.
	error6.3_1
	error6.3_2
	error6.3_3
	error6.3_30
	error6.3_4
	error6.3_5 -- these files contain the error messages that
		the system prints out.
	grafile6.3 -- the dayfile for geoquel.
	proctab6.3 -- the process table.  INGRES reads this to
		decide what programs to load.
	ttytype -- defines the terminal types on your system for
		various ports.  Used by geoquel.
	usage -- printed out by the INGRES driver when there is
		something wrong.  Right now it is quite short,
		but you could give a verbose message if that is
		appropriate for your user population.
