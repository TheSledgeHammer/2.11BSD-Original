.../source

This directory is the root of the source code subtree.  All
system sources reside in this directory.  If you are short of
disk space and do not intend to recompile the system, this
directory tree can be removed.  Much space will be saved.

To compile a new system and install it in the local directories,
use

	make install

To install a system in the system directories, use

	make install sysinstall DESTDIR=/usr

which will install everything in /usr/bin and /usr/lib.

Each subdirectory represents a subsystem of INGRES.  Makefiles
have entries for install in each case.  To simply recompile
a module, just use "make" with no arguments.
