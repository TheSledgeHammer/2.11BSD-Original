NAME
     quiz - test your knowledge

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/games/quiz [ -i file ] [ -t ] [ category1 category2 ]

DESCRIPTION
     _Q_u_i_z gives associative knowledge tests on various subjects.
     It asks items chosen from _c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y_1 and expects answers from
     _c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y_2.  If no categories are specified, _q_u_i_z gives
     instructions and lists the available categories.

     _Q_u_i_z tells a correct answer whenever you type a bare new-
     line.  At the end of input, upon interrupt, or when ques-
     tions run out, _q_u_i_z reports a score and terminates.

     The -t flag specifies `tutorial' mode, where missed ques-
     tions are repeated later, and material is gradually intro-
     duced as you learn.

     The -i flag causes the named file to be substituted for the
     default index file.  The lines of these files have the  syn-
     tax:
	  line	    = category newline | category `:' line
	  category  = alternate | category `|' alternate
	  alternate = empty | alternate primary
	  primary   = character | `[' category `]' | option
	  option    = `{' category `}'

     The first category on each line of an index file names an
     information file.	The remaining categories specify the
     order and contents of the data in each line of the informa-
     tion file.  Information files have the same syntax.
     Backslash `\' is used as with _s_h(1) to quote syntactically
     significant characters or to insert transparent newlines
     into a line.  When either a question or its answer is empty,
     _q_u_i_z will refrain from asking it.

FILES
     /usr/games/quiz.k/*

BUGS
     The construct `a|ab' doesn't work in an information file.
     Use `a{b}'.
