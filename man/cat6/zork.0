NAME
     zork - the game of dungeon

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/games/zork

DESCRIPTION
     _D_u_n_g_e_o_n is a computer fantasy simulation based on Adventure
     and on Dungeons & Dragons, originally written by Lebling,
     Blank, and Anderson of MIT.  In it you explore a dungeon
     made up of various rooms, caves, rivers, and so on.  The
     object of the game is to collect as much treasure as possi-
     ble and stow it safely in the trophy case (and, of course,
     to stay alive.)

     Figuring out the rules is part of the game, but if you are
     stuck, you should start off with "open mailbox", "take
     leaflet", and then "read leaflet".  Additional useful com-
     mands that are not documented include:

     quit (to end the game)

     !cmd (the usual shell escape convention)

     >	  (to save a game)

     <	  (to restore a game)
