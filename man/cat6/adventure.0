NAME
     adventure - an exploration game

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/games/adventure

DESCRIPTION
     The object of the game is to locate and explore Colossal
     Cave, find the treasures hidden there, and bring them back
     to the building with you.	The program is self-descriptive
     to a point, but part of the game is to discover its rules.

     To terminate a game, type `quit'; to save a game for later
     resumption, type `suspend'.

BUGS
     Saving a game creates a large executable file instead of
     just the information needed to resume the game.
