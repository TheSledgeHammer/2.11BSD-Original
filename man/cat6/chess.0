NAME
     chess - the game of chess

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/games/chess

DESCRIPTION
     _C_h_e_s_s is a computer program that plays class D chess.  Moves
     may be given either in standard (descriptive) notation or in
     algebraic notation.  The symbol `+' is used to specify
     check; `o-o' and `o-o-o' specify castling.  To play black,
     type `first'; to print the board, type an empty line.

     Each move is echoed in the appropriate notation followed by
     the program's reply.

FILES
     /usr/games/lib/book opening `book'

DIAGNOSTICS
     The most cryptic diagnostic is `eh?' which means that the
     input was syntactically incorrect.

WARNING
     Over-use of this program will cause it to go away.

BUGS
     Pawns may be promoted only to queens.
