NAME
     bj - the game of black jack

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/games/bj

DESCRIPTION
     _B_j is a serious attempt at simulating the dealer in the game
     of black jack (or twenty-one) as might be found in Reno.
     The following rules apply:

     The bet is $2 every hand.

	  A player `natural' (black jack) pays $3.  A dealer
	  natural loses $2.  Both dealer and player naturals is a
	  `push' (no money exchange).

	  If the dealer has an ace up, the player is allowed to
	  make an `insurance' bet against the chance of a dealer
	  natural.  If this bet is not taken, play resumes as
	  normal.  If the bet is taken, it is a side bet where
	  the player wins $2 if the dealer has a natural and
	  loses $1 if the dealer does not.

	  If the player is dealt two cards of the same value, he
	  is allowed to `double'.  He is allowed to play two
	  hands, each with one of these cards.	(The bet is dou-
	  bled also; $2 on each hand.)

	  If a dealt hand has a total of ten or eleven, the
	  player may `double down'.  He may double the bet ($2 to
	  $4) and receive exactly one more card on that hand.

	  Under normal play, the player may `hit' (draw a card)
	  as long as his total is not over twenty-one.	If the
	  player `busts' (goes over twenty-one), the dealer wins
	  the bet.

	  When the player `stands' (decides not to hit), the
	  dealer hits until he attains a total of seventeen or
	  more.  If the dealer busts, the player wins the bet.

	  If both player and dealer stand, the one with the larg-
	  est total wins.  A tie is a push.

     The machine deals and keeps score.  The following questions
     will be asked at appropriate times.  Each question is
     answered by y followed by a new line for `yes', or just new
     line for `no'.

     ?	       (means, `do you want a hit?')
     Insurance?

     Double down?

     Every time the deck is shuffled, the dealer so states and
     the `action' (total bet) and `standing' (total won or lost)
     is printed.  To exit, hit the interrupt key (DEL) and the
     action and standing will be printed.
