WORMS(6)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual		 WORMS(6)



NAME
     worms  -  animate worms on a display terminal

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/games/worms [ -field ] [ -length # ] [ -number # ] [
     -trail ]

DESCRIPTION
     Brian Horn (cithep!bdh) showed me a _T_O_P_S-_2_0 program  on  the
     DEC-2136  machine	called _W_O_R_M, and suggested that I write a
     similar program that would run under _U_n_i_x.  I  did,  and  no
     apologies.

     -field makes a "field" for the worm(s) to eat; -trail causes
     each  worm  to  leave a trail behind it.  You can figure out
     the rest by yourself.

FILES
     /etc/termcap

BUGS

     properly on a terminal that wraps at the right margin.

     Terminal initialization is not performed.
