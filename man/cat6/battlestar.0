NAME
     battlestar - a tropical adventure game

SYNOPSIS
     battlestar [ -r (recover a saved game) ]

DESCRIPTION
     _B_a_t_t_l_e_s_t_a_r is an adventure game in the classic style.  How-
     ever, It's slightly less of a puzzle and more a game of
     exploration.  There are a few magical words in the game, but
     on the whole, simple English should suffice to make one's
     desires understandable to the parser.

THE SETTING
     In the days before the darkness came, when battlestars ruled
     the heavens...

	       Three He made and gave them to His daughters,
	       Beautiful nymphs, the goddesses of the waters.
	       One to bring good luck and simple feats of wonder,
	       Two to wash the lands and churn the waves asunder,
	       Three to rule the world and purge the skies with thunder.


     In those times great wizards were known and their powers
     were beyond belief.  They could take any object from thin
     air, and, uttering the word

     In those times men were known for their lust of gold and
     desire to wear fine weapons.  Swords and coats of mail were
     fashioned that could withstand a laser blast.

     But when the darkness fell, the rightful reigns were top-
     pled.  Swords and helms and heads of state went rolling
     across the grass.	The entire fleet of battlestars was
     reduced to a single ship.

IMPLIED OBJECTS
	  >-: take watermellon
	  watermellon:
	  Taken.
	  >-: eat
	  watermellon:
	  Eaten.
	  >-: take knife and sword and apple, drop all
	  knife:
	  Taken.
	  broadsword:
	  Taken.
	  apple:
	  Taken.
	  knife:
	  Dropped.
	  broadsword:
	  Dropped.
	  apple:
	  Dropped.
	  >-: get
	  knife:
	  Taken.


     Notice that the "shadow" of the next word stays around if
     you want to take advantage of it.	That is, saying "take
     knife" and then "drop" will drop the knife you just took.

SCORE & INVEN
     The two commands "score" and "inven" will print out your
     current status in the game.

SAVING A GAME
     The command "save" will save your game in a file called
     "Bstar."  You can recover a saved game by using the "-r"
     option when you start up the game.

DIRECTIONS
     The compass directions N, S, E, and W can be used if you
     have a compass.  If you don't have a compass, you'll have to
     say R, L, A, or B, which stand for Right, Left, Ahead, and
     Back.  Directions printed in room descriptions are always
     printed in R, L, A, & B relative directions.

HISTORY
     I wrote Battlestar in 1979 in order to experiment with the
     niceties of the C Language.  Most interesting things that
     happen in the game are hardwired into the code, so don't
     send me any hate mail about it!  Instead, enjoy art for
     art's sake!
