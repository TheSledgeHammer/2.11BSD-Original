NAME
     rogue - Exploring The Dungeons of Doom

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/games/rogue [ -r ] [ _s_a_v_e__f_i_l_e ] [ -s ] [ -d ]

DESCRIPTION
     _R_o_g_u_e is a computer fantasy game with a new twist.  It is
     crt oriented and the object of the game is to survive the
     attacks of various monsters and get a lot of gold, rather
     than the puzzle solving orientation of most computer fantasy
     games.

     To get started you really only need to know two commands.
     The command ? will give you a list of the available commands
     and the command / will identify the things you see on the
     screen.

     To win the game (as opposed to merely playing to beat other
     people's high scores) you must locate the Amulet of Yendor
     which is somewhere below the 20th level of the dungeon and
     get it out.  Nobody has achieved this yet and if somebody
     does, they will probably go down in history as a hero among
     heroes.

     When the game ends, either by your death, when you quit, or
     if you (by some miracle) manage to win, _r_o_g_u_e will give you
     a list of the top-ten scorers.  The scoring is based
     entirely upon how much gold you get.  There is a 10% penalty
     for getting yourself killed.

     If _s_a_v_e__f_i_l_e is specified, rogue will be restored from the
     specified saved game file.  If the -r option is used, the
     save game file is presumed to be the default.

     The -s option will print out the list of scores.

     The -d option will kill you and try to add you to the score
     file.

     _t_h_e _D_u_n_g_e_o_n_s _o_f _D_o_o_m.

BUGS
     Probably infinite (although countably infinite).  However,
     that Ice Monsters sometimes transfix you permanently is _n_o_t
     a bug.  It's a feature.
