DESCRIPTION
     _M_o_o is a guessing game imported from England.  The computer

     The player guesses four distinct digits being scored on each
     guess.  A `cow' is a correct digit in an incorrect position.
     A `bull' is a correct digit in a correct position.  The game
     continues until the player guesses the number (a score of
     four bulls).
