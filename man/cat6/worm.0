NAME
     worm - Play the growing worm game

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/games/worm [ _s_i_z_e ]

DESCRIPTION
     In _w_o_r_m, you are a little worm, your body is the "o"'s on
     the screen and your head is the "@".  You move with the hjkl
     keys (as in the game snake).  If you don't press any keys,
     you continue in the direction you last moved.  The upper
     case HJKL keys move you as if you had pressed several (9 for
     HL and 5 for JK) of the corresponding lower case key (unless
     you run into a digit, then it stops).

     On the screen you will see a digit, if your worm eats the
     digit is will grow longer, the actual amount longer depends
     on which digit it was that you ate.  The object of the game
     is to see how long you can make the worm grow.

     The game ends when the worm runs into either the sides of
     the screen, or itself.  The current score (how much the worm
     has grown) is kept in the upper left corner of the screen.

     The optional argument, if present, is the initial length of
     the worm.

BUGS
     If the initial length of the worm is set to less than one or
     more than 75, various strange things happen.
