NAME
     hunt - a multi-player multi-terminal game

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/games/hunt [-q] [-m] [hostname] [-l name]

DESCRIPTION
     The object of the game _h_u_n_t is to kill off the other
     players.  There are no rooms, no treasures, and no monsters.
     Instead, you wander around a maze, find grenades, trip
     mines, and shoot down walls and players.  The more players
     you kill before you die, the better your score is.  If the
     -m flag is given, you enter the game as a monitor (you can
     see the action but you cannot play).

     _H_u_n_t normally looks for an active game on the local network;
     if none is found, it starts one up on the local host.  One
     may specify the location of the game by giving the _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e
     argument.	The player name may be specified on the command
     line by using the -l option.  This command syntax was chosen
     for _r_l_o_g_i_n/_r_s_h compatibility.  If the -q flag is given, _h_u_n_t
     queries the network and reports if an active game were
     found.  This is useful for .login scripts.

     _H_u_n_t only works on crt (vdt) terminals with at least 24
     lines, 80 columns, and cursor addressing.	The screen is
     divided in to 3 areas.  On the right hand side is the status
     area.  It shows you how much damage you've sustained, how
     many charges you have left, who's in the game, who's scan-
     ning (the asterisk in front of the name), who's cloaked (the
     plus sign in front of the name), and other players' scores.
     Most of the rest of the screen is taken up by your map of
     the maze, except for the 24th line, which is used for longer
     messages that don't fit in the status area.

     _H_u_n_t uses the same keys to move as _v_i does, _i._e., h,j,k, and
     l for left, down, up, right respectively.	To change which
     direction you're facing in the maze, use the upper case ver-
     sion of the movement key (_i._e., HJKL).

     Other commands are:

	  f	- Fire (in the direction you're facing) (Takes 1 charge)
	  g	- Throw grenade (in the direction you're facing) (Takes 9 charges)
	  F	- Throw satchel charge (Takes 25 charges)
	  G	- Throw bomb (Takes 49 charges)
	  o	- Throw small slime bomb (Takes 15 charges)
	  O	- Throw big slime bomb (Takes 30 charges)
	  s	- Scan (show where other players are) (Takes 1 charge)
	  c	- Cloak (hide from scanners) (Takes 1 charge)

	  ^L	- Redraw screen

	  q	- Quit

     Knowing what the symbols on the screen often helps:

	  -|+	- walls
	  /\	- diagonal (deflecting) walls
	  #	- doors (dispersion walls)
	  ;	- small mine
	  g	- large mine
	  :	- shot
	  o	- grenade
	  O	- satchel charge
	  @	- bomb
	  s	- small slime bomb
	  $	- big slime bomb
	  ><^v	- you facing right, left, up, or down
	  }{i!	- other players facing right, left, up, or down
	  *	- explosion
	  \|/
	  -*-	- grenade and large mine explosion
	  /|\

     Satchel and bomb explosions are larger than grenades (5x5, 7x7,
	  and 3x3 respectively).

     Other helpful hints:

     [] You can only fire in the direction you are facing.
     [] You can only fire three shots in a row, then the gun must
	cool.
     [] A shot only affects the square it hits.
     [] Shots and grenades move 5 times faster than you do.
     [] To stab someone, you must face that player and move at
	them.
     [] Stabbing does 2 points worth of damage and shooting does
	5 points.
     [] Slime does 5 points of damage each time it hits.
     [] You start with 15 charges and get 5 more for every new
	player.
     [] A grenade affects the nine squares centered about the
	square it hits.
     [] A satchel affects the twenty-five squares centered about
	the square it hits.
     [] A bomb affects the forty-nine squares centered about the
	square it hits.
     [] Slime affects all squares it oozes over (15 or 30 respec-
	tively).
     [] One small mine and one large mine is placed in the maze
	for every new player.  A mine has a 5% probability of
	tripping when you walk directly at it; 50% when going
	sideways on to it; 95% when backing up on to it.  Trip-
	ping a mine costs you 5 points or 10 points respectively.

	Defusing a mine is worth 1 charge or 9 charges respec-
	tively.
     [] You cannot see behind you.
     [] Scanning lasts for (20 times the number of players)
	turns.	Scanning takes 1 ammo charge, so don't waste all
	your charges scanning.
     [] Cloaking lasts for 20 turns.
     [] Whenever you kill someone, you get 2 more damage capacity
	points and 2 damage points taken away.
     [] Maximum typeahead is 5 characters.
     [] A shot destroys normal (_i._e., non-diagonal, non-door)
	walls.
     [] Diagonal walls deflect shots and change orientation.
     [] Doors disperse shots in random directions (up, down,
	left, right).
     [] Diagonal walls and doors cannot be destroyed by direct
	shots but may be destroyed by an adjacent grenade explo-
	sion.
     [] Slime goes around walls, not through them.
     [] Walls regenerate, reappearing in the order they were des-
	troyed.  One percent of the regenerated walls will be
	diagonal walls or doors.  When a wall is generated
	directly beneath a player, he is thrown in a random
	direction for a random period of time.	When he lands, he
	sustains damage (up to 20 percent of the amount of damage
	he had before impact); that is, the less damage he had,
	the more nimble he is and therefore less likely to hurt
	himself on landing.



     [] The environment variable HUNT is checked to get the
	player name.  If you don't have this variable set, _h_u_n_t
	will ask you what name you want to play under.	If it is
	set, you may also set up a single character keyboard map,
	but then you have to enumerate the options:
		  _e._g. setenv HUNT
	``name=Sneaky,mapkey=zoFfGg1f2g3F4G''
	sets the player name to Sneaky, and the maps z to o, F to
	f, G to g, 1 to f, 2 to g, 3 to F, and 4 to G.	The _m_a_p_-
	_k_e_y option must be last.
     [] It's a boring game if you're the only one playing.

     Your score is the ratio of number of kills to number of
     times you entered the game and is only kept for the duration
     of a single session of _h_u_n_t.

     _H_u_n_t normally drives up the load average to be about
     (number_of_players + 0.5) greater than it would be without a
     _h_u_n_t game executing.  A limit of three players per host and
     nine players total is enforced by _h_u_n_t.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
     We thank Don Kneller, John Thomason, Eric Pettersen, and
     Scott Weiner for providing endless hours of play-testing to
     improve the character of the game.  We hope their signifi-
     cant others will forgive them; we certainly don't.

BUGS
     To keep up the pace, not everything is as realistic as pos-
     sible.

     There were some bugs in early releases of 4.2 BSD that _h_u_n_t
     helped discover; _h_u_n_t will crash your system if those bugs
     haven't been fixed.
