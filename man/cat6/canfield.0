NAME
     canfield, cfscores - the solitaire card game canfield

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/games/canfield
     /usr/games/cfscores

DESCRIPTION
     If you have never played solitaire before, it is recommended
     that you consult a solitaire instruction book. In Canfield,
     tableau cards may be built on each other downward in alter-
     nate colors. An entire pile must be moved as a unit in
     building. Top cards of the piles are available to be played
     on foundations, but never into empty spaces.

     Spaces must be filled from the stock. The top card of the
     stock also is available to be played on foundations or built
     on tableau piles. After the stock is exhausted, tableau
     spaces may be filled from the talon and the player may keep
     them open until he wishes to use them.

     Cards are dealt from the hand to the talon by threes and
     this repeats until there are no more cards in the hand or
     the player quits. To have cards dealt onto the talon the
     player types 'ht' for his move. Foundation base cards are
     also automatically moved to the foundation when they become
     available.

     The command 'c' causes _c_a_n_f_i_e_l_d to maintain card counting
     statistics on the bottom of the screen. When properly used
     this can greatly increase one's chances of winning.

     The rules for betting are somewhat less strict than those
     used in the official version of the game.	The initial deal
     costs $13.  You may quit at this point or inspect the game.
     Inspection costs $13 and allows you to make as many moves as
     possible without moving any cards from your hand to the
     talon.  (The initial deal places three cards on the talon;
     if all these cards are used, three more are made available.)
     Finally, if the game seems interesting, you must pay the
     final installment of $26.	At this point you are credited at
     the rate of $5 for each card on the foundation; as the game
     progresses you are credited with $5 for each card that is
     moved to the foundation.  Each run through the hand after
     the first costs $5.  The card counting feature costs $1 for
     each unknown card that is identified.  If the information is
     toggled on, you are only charged for cards that became visi-
     ble since it was last turned on.  Thus the maximum cost of
     information is $34.  Playing time is charged at a rate of $1
     per minute.

     With no arguments, the program _c_f_s_c_o_r_e_s prints out the
     current status of your canfield account.  If a user name is
     specified, it prints out the status of their canfield
     account.  If the -a flag is specified, it prints out the
     canfield accounts for all users that have played the game
     since the database was set up.

FILES
     /usr/games/canfield the game itself
     /usr/games/cfscores the database printer
     /usr/games/lib/cfscores  the database of scores
