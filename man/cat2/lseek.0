NAME
     lseek - move read/write pointer

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/file.h>

     #define L_SET   0 /* set the seek pointer */
     #define L_INCR  1 /* increment the seek pointer */
     #define L_XTND  2 /* extend the file size */

     pos = lseek(d, offset, whence)
     off_t pos;
     int d;
     off_t offset;
     int whence;

DESCRIPTION
     The descriptor _d refers to a file or device open for reading
     and/or writing.  _L_s_e_e_k sets the file pointer of _d as fol-
     lows:

	  If _w_h_e_n_c_e is L_SET, the pointer is set to _o_f_f_s_e_t bytes.

	  If _w_h_e_n_c_e is L_INCR, the pointer is set to its current
	  location plus _o_f_f_s_e_t.

	  If _w_h_e_n_c_e is L_XTND, the pointer is set to the size of
	  the file plus _o_f_f_s_e_t.

     Upon successful completion, the resulting pointer location
     as measured in bytes from beginning of the file is returned.
     Some devices are incapable of seeking.  The value of the
     pointer associated with such a device is undefined.

NOTES
     Seeking far beyond the end of a file, then writing, creates
     a gap or "hole", which occupies no physical space and reads
     as zeros.

RETURN VALUE
     Upon successful completion, the current file pointer value
     is returned.  Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o
     is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     _L_s_e_e_k will fail and the file pointer will remain unchanged
     if:

     [EBADF]	    _F_i_l_d_e_s is not an open file descriptor.

     [ESPIPE]	    _F_i_l_d_e_s is associated with a pipe or a socket.

     [EINVAL]	    _W_h_e_n_c_e is not a proper value.

BUGS
     This document's use of _w_h_e_n_c_e is incorrect English, but
     maintained for historical reasons.
