NAME
     utimes - set file times

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/time.h>

     utimes(file, tvp)
     char *file;
     struct timeval tvp[2];

DESCRIPTION
     The _u_t_i_m_e_s call uses the "accessed" and "updated" times in
     that order from the _t_v_p vector to set the corresponding
     recorded times for _f_i_l_e.

     The caller must be the owner of the file or the super-user.
     The "inode-changed" time of the file is set to the current
     time.

RETURN VALUE
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Oth-
     erwise, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cate the error.

     [EINVAL]	    The pathname contains a character with the
		    high-order bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A component of a pathname exceeded 255 char-
		    acters, or an entire path name exceeded 1023
		    characters.

     [ENOENT]	    The named file does not exist.

     [ELOOP]	    Too many symbolic links were encountered in
		    translating the pathname.

     [EPERM]	    The process is not super-user and not the
		    owner of the file.

     [EACCES]	    Search permission is denied for a component
		    of the path prefix.

     [EROFS]	    The file system containing the file is
		    mounted read-only.

     [EFAULT]	    _F_i_l_e or _t_v_p points outside the process's
