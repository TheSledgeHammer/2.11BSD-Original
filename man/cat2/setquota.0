NAME
     setquota - enable/disable quotas on a file system

SYNOPSIS
     setquota(special, file)
     char *special, *file;

DESCRIPTION
     Disc quotas are enabled or disabled with the _s_e_t_q_u_o_t_a call.
     _S_p_e_c_i_a_l indicates a block special device on which a mounted
     file system exists.  If _f_i_l_e is nonzero, it specifies a file
     in that file system from which to take the quotas.  If _f_i_l_e
     is 0, then quotas are disabled on the file system.  The
     quota file must exist; it is normally created with the _q_u_o_-
     _t_a_c_h_e_c_k(8) program.

     Only the super-user may turn quotas on or off.

SEE ALSO
     quota(2), quotacheck(8), quotaon(8)

RETURN VALUE
     A 0 return value indicates a successful call.  A value of -1
     is returned when an error occurs and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cate the reason for failure.

ERRORS
     _S_e_t_q_u_o_t_a will fail when one of the following occurs:

     [ENOTDIR]	    A component of either path prefix is not a
		    directory.

     [EINVAL]	    Either pathname contains a character with the
		    high-order bit set.

     [EINVAL]	    The kernel has not been compiled with the
		    QUOTA option.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A component of either pathname exceeded 255
		    characters, or the entire length of either
		    path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENODEV]	    _S_p_e_c_i_a_l does not exist.

     [ENOENT]	    _F_i_l_e does not exist.

     [ELOOP]	    Too many symbolic links were encountered in
		    translating either pathname.

     [EPERM]	    The caller is not the super-user.

     [ENOTBLK]	    _S_p_e_c_i_a_l is not a block device.

SETQUOTA(2)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	      SETQUOTA(2)



     [ENXIO]	    The major device number of _s_p_e_c_i_a_l is out of
		    range (this indicates no device driver exists
		    for the associated hardware).

     [EROFS]	    _F_i_l_e resides on a read-only file system.

     [EACCES]	    Search permission is denied for a component
		    of either path prefix.

     [EACCES]	    _F_i_l_e resides on a file system different from
		    _s_p_e_c_i_a_l.

     [EACCES]	    _F_i_l_e is not a plain file.

     [EIO]	    An I/O error occurred while reading from or
		    writing to the file containing the quotas.

     [EFAULT]	    _S_p_e_c_i_a_l or _p_a_t_h points outside the process's
		    allocated address space.

BUGS
     The error codes are in a state of disarray; too many errors
     appear to the caller as one value.
