NAME
     setregid - set real and effective group ID

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     _i_n_t
     setregid(rgid, egid)
	  gid_t rgid, egid

DESCRIPTION
     The real and effective group ID's of the current process are
     set to the arguments.  Unprivileged users may change the
     real group ID to the effective group ID and vice-versa; only
     the super-user may make other changes.

     Supplying a value of -1 for either the real or effective
     group ID forces the system to substitute the current ID in
     place of the -1 parameter.

     The setregid function was intended to allow swapping the
     real and effective group IDs in set-group-ID programs to
     temporarily relinquish the set-group-ID value.  This func-
     tion did not work correctly, and its purpose is now better
     served by the use of the setegid function (see setuid(2)).

     When setting the real and effective group IDs to the same
     value, the standard setgid function is preferred.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Oth-
     erwise, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cate the error.

ERRORS
     EPERM     The current process is not the super-user and a
	       change other than changing the effective group-id
	       to the real group-id was specified.

SEE ALSO
     getgid(2), setegid(2), setgid(2), setuid(2)

HISTORY
     The setregid function call appeared in 4.2BSD and was
     dropped in 4.4BSD.
