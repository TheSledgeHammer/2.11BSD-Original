NAME
     killpg - send signal to a process group

SYNOPSIS
     killpg(pgrp, sig)
     int pgrp, sig;

DESCRIPTION
     _K_i_l_l_p_g sends the signal _s_i_g to the process group _p_g_r_p.  See
     _s_i_g_v_e_c(2) for a list of signals.

     The sending process and members of the process group must
     have the same effective user ID, or the sender must be the
     super-user.  As a single special case the continue signal
     SIGCONT may be sent to any process that is a descendant of
     the current process.

RETURN VALUE
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Oth-
     erwise, a value of -1 is returned and the global variable
     _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     _K_i_l_l_p_g will fail and no signal will be sent if any of the
     following occur:

     [EINVAL]	    _S_i_g is not a valid signal number.

     [ESRCH]	    No process can be found in the process group
		    specified by _p_g_r_p.

     [ESRCH]	    The process group was given as 0 but the
		    sending process does not have a process
		    group.

     [EPERM]	    The sending process is not the super-user and
		    one or more of the target processes has an
		    effective user ID different from that of the
		    sending process.
