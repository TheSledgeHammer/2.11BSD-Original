GETUID(2)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual		GETUID(2)



NAME
     getuid, geteuid - get user identification

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <sys/types.h>

     _u_i_d__t
     getuid()

     _u_i_d__t
     geteuid()

DESCRIPTION
     The getuid function returns the real user ID of the calling
     process.  The geteuid function returns the effective user ID
     of the calling process.

     The real user ID is that of the user who has invoked the
     program.  As the effective user ID gives the process addi-
     tional permissions during execution of ``_s_e_t-_u_s_e_r-_I_D'' mode
     processes, getuid is used to determine the real-user-id of
     the calling process.

ERRORS
     The getuid and geteuid functions are always successful, and
     no return value is reserved to indicate an error.

SEE ALSO
     getgid(2), setreuid(2)

STANDARDS
     Geteuid and getuid conform to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988
     (``POSIX'').
