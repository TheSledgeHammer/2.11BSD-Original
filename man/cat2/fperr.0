NAME
     fperr - get floating-point error registers (2BSD)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pdp/fperr.h>

     struct fperr
     {
	  short     f_fec;
	  caddr_t   f_fea;
     };

     fperr(fpe)
     struct fperr *fpe;

DESCRIPTION
     _F_p_e_r_r returns the contents of the floating-point processor's
     error registers as they were following the last floating
     exception generated by the calling process.  The registers
     are stored in the structure pointed to by _f_p_e.

     This call is required because the error registers in the
     PDP-11 floating-point processor are read-only.  Thus, they
     may be changed by some other process between the time that
     the current process generates an exception and the time that
     it reads the registers.  Therefore, the system saves their
     state at the time of an exception.

     The values returned are valid only after a floating-point
     exception.

ERRORS
     [EINVAL]	    The kernel has not been compiled for a pro-
		    cessor with floating point.

BUGS
     _F_p_e_r_r is unique to the PDP-11 and 2BSD; its use is
     discouraged.
