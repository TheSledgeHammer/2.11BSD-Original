NAME
     gethostid, sethostid - get/set unique identifier of current
     host

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
     _S_e_t_h_o_s_t_i_d establishes a 32-bit identifier for the current
     processor that is intended to be unique among all UNIX sys-
     tems in existence.  This is normally a DARPA Internet
     address for the local machine.  This call is allowed only to
     the super-user and is normally performed at boot time.

     _G_e_t_h_o_s_t_i_d returns the 32-bit identifier for the current pro-
     cessor.

SEE ALSO
     hostid(1), gethostname(2)

BUGS
     32 bits for the identifier is too small.
