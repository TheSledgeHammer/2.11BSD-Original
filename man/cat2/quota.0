NAME
     quota - manipulate disk quotas

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/quota.h>

     quota(cmd, uid, arg, addr)
     int cmd, uid, arg;
     char *addr;

DESCRIPTION
     The _q_u_o_t_a call manipulates disk quotas for file systems that
     have had quotas enabled with _s_e_t_q_u_o_t_a(2).	The _c_m_d parameter
     indicates a command to be applied to the user ID _u_i_d.  _A_r_g
     is a command specific argument and _a_d_d_r is the address of an
     optional, command specific, data structure that is copied in
     or out of the system.  The interpretation of _a_r_g and _a_d_d_r is
     given with each command below.

     Q_SETDLIM
	  Set disc quota limits and current usage for the user
	  with ID _u_i_d.	_A_r_g is a major-minor device indicating a
	  particular file system.  _A_d_d_r is a pointer to a struct
	  dqblk structure (defined in <_s_y_s/_q_u_o_t_a._h>).  This call
	  is restricted to the super-user.

     Q_GETDLIM
	  Get disc quota limits and current usage for the user
	  with ID _u_i_d.	The remaining parameters are as for
	  Q_SETDLIM.

     Q_SETDUSE
	  Set disc usage limits for the user with ID _u_i_d.  _A_r_g is
	  a major-minor device indicating a particular file sys-
	  tem.	_A_d_d_r is a pointer to a struct dqusage structure
	  (defined in <_s_y_s/_q_u_o_t_a._h>).  This call is restricted to
	  the super-user.

     Q_SYNC
	  Update the on-disc copy of quota usages.  _A_r_g is a
	  major-minor device indicating the file system to be
	  sync'ed.  If the _a_r_g parameter is specified as NODEV,
	  all file systems that have disc quotas will be sync'ed.
	  The _u_i_d and _a_d_d_r parameters are ignored.

     Q_SETUID
	  Change the calling process's quota limits to those of
	  the user with ID _u_i_d.  The _a_r_g and _a_d_d_r parameters are
	  ignored.  This call is restricted to the super-user.

     Q_SETWARN
	  Alter the disc usage warning limits for the user with

	  ID _u_i_d.  _A_r_g is a major-minor device indicating a par-
	  ticular file system.	_A_d_d_r is a pointer to a struct
	  dqwarn structure (defined in <_s_y_s/_q_u_o_t_a._h>).	This call
	  is restricted to the super-user.

     Q_DOWARN
	  Warn the user with user ID _u_i_d about excessive disc
	  usage.  This call causes the system to check its
	  current disc usage information and print a message on
	  the terminal of the caller for each file system on
	  which the user is over quota.  If the user is under
	  quota, his warning count is reset to MAX_*_WARN
	  (defined in <_s_y_s/_q_u_o_t_a._h>).  If the _a_r_g parameter is
	  specified as NODEV, all file systems that have disc
	  quotas will be checked.  Otherwise, _a_r_g indicates a
	  specific major-minor device to be checked.  This call
	  is restricted to the super-user.

RETURN VALUE
     A successful call returns 0, otherwise the value -1 is
     returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o indicates the reason
     for the failure.

ERRORS
     A _q_u_o_t_a call will fail when one of the following occurs:

     [EINVAL]	    The kernel has not been compiled with the
		    QUOTA option.

     [EINVAL]	    _C_m_d is invalid.

     [ESRCH]	    No disc quota is found for the indicated
		    user.

     [EPERM]	    The call is priviledged and the caller was
		    not the super-user.

     [ENODEV]	    The _a_r_g parameter is being interpreted as a
		    major-minor device and it indicates an
		    unmounted file system.

     [EFAULT]	    An invalid _a_d_d_r is supplied; the associated
		    structure could not be copied in or out of
		    the kernel.

     [EUSERS]	    The quota table is full.

BUGS
     There should be some way to integrate this call with the

     resource limit interface provided by _s_e_t_r_l_i_m_i_t(2) and
     _g_e_t_r_l_i_m_i_t(2).

     The Australian spelling of _d_i_s_k is used throughout the quota
     facilities in honor of the implementors.
