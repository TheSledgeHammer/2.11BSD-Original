NAME
     fetchi - fetch from user instruction space (2BSD)

SYNOPSIS
     fetchi(addr)
     int *addr;

DESCRIPTION
     _F_e_t_c_h_i fetches the word at _a_d_d_r from the caller's instruc-
     tion space.  This system call is required on PDP-11's with
     separate instruction and data spaces because the _m_f_p_i
     instruction reads from D-space if the current and previous
     modes in the program status word are both user.

RETURN VALUE
     Upon successful completion the contents of the caller's
     instruction space at _a_d_d_r are returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned.

ERRORS
     [EINVAL]	    The kernel has not been compiled for a pro-
		    cessor with separate I/D.

     [EFAULT]	    _A_d_d_r points to an address not in the
		    process's allocated instruction space.

BUGS
     The error indication, -1, is a legitimate function value;
     _e_r_r_n_o, (see _i_n_t_r_o(2)), can be used to disambiguate.

     _F_e_t_c_h_i is a kludge and exists only to circumvent an alleged
     security feature on some DEC PDP-11 processors.

     _F_e_t_c_h_i is unique to the PDP-11 and 2BSD; its use is
     discouraged.
