NAME
     ucall - call a kernel subroutine from user mode (2BSD)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pdp/psl.h>
     #include <sys/types.h>

     ucall(priority, function, arg0, arg1)
     int priority, arg0, arg1;
     caddr_t function;

DESCRIPTION
     _U_c_a_l_l causes the processor priority to be set to _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y
     and the specified kernel _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n to be called with argu-
     ments _a_r_g_0 and _a_r_g_1.  _P_r_i_o_r_i_t_y is one of PSL_BR0, ...,
     PSL_BR7.  Processor priority is reset to PSL_BR0 when _f_u_n_c_-
     _t_i_o_n returns.

     _U_c_a_l_l is allowed only if the user is the superuser.  It is
     obviously extremely dangerous if misused.	It's only current
     use is at system boot time to configure system devices by
     calling device drivers ...

ERRORS
     [EPERM]	    The caller is not the super-user.

SEE ALSO
     autoconfig(8)

BUGS
     No address validations are attempted.

     _U_c_a_l_l is unique to the PDP-11 and 2BSD; its use is
     discouraged.
