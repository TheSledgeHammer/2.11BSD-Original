GETGID(2)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual		GETGID(2)



NAME
     getgid, getegid - get group process identification

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>

     _g_i_d__t
     getgid()

     _g_i_d__t
     getegid()

DESCRIPTION
     The getgid function returns the real group ID of the calling
     process, getegid returns the effective group ID of the cal-
     ling process.

     The real group ID is specified at login time.

     The real group ID is the group of the user who invoked the
     program.  As the effective group ID gives the process addi-
     tional permissions during the execution of ``_s_e_t-_g_r_o_u_p-_I_D''
     mode processes, getgid is used to determine the real-user-id
     of the calling process.

ERRORS
     The getgid and getegid functions are always successful, and
     no return value is reserved to indicate an error.

SEE ALSO
     getuid(2), setregid(2), setgid(3)

STANDARDS
     Getgid and getegid conform to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988
     (``POSIX'').
