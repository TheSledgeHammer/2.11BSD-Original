NAME
     symlink - make symbolic link to a file

SYNOPSIS
     symlink(name1, name2)
     char *name1, *name2;

DESCRIPTION
     A symbolic link _n_a_m_e_2 is created to _n_a_m_e_1 (_n_a_m_e_2 is the name
     of the file created, _n_a_m_e_1 is the string used in creating
     the symbolic link).  Either name may be an arbitrary path
     name; the files need not be on the same file system.

RETURN VALUE
     Upon successful completion, a zero value is returned.  If an
     error occurs, the error code is stored in _e_r_r_n_o and a -1
     value is returned.

ERRORS
     The symbolic link is made unless on or more of the following
     are true:

     [ENOTDIR]	    A component of the _n_a_m_e_2 prefix is not a
		    directory.

     [EINVAL]	    Either _n_a_m_e_1 or _n_a_m_e_2 contains a character
		    with the high-order bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A component of either pathname exceeded 255
		    characters, or the entire length of either
		    path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]	    The named file does not exist.

     [EACCES]	    A component of the _n_a_m_e_2 path prefix denies
		    search permission.

     [ELOOP]	    Too many symbolic links were encountered in
		    translating the pathname.

     [EEXIST]	    _N_a_m_e_2 already exists.

     [EIO]	    An I/O error occurred while making the direc-
		    tory entry for _n_a_m_e_2, or allocating the inode
		    for _n_a_m_e_2, or writing out the link contents
		    of _n_a_m_e_2.

     [EROFS]	    The file _n_a_m_e_2 would reside on a read-only
		    file system.

     [ENOSPC]	    The directory in which the entry for the new
		    symbolic link is being placed cannot be

		    extended because there is no space left on
		    the file system containing the directory.

     [ENOSPC]	    The new symbolic link cannot be created
		    because there there is no space left on the
		    file system that will contain the symbolic
		    link.

     [ENOSPC]	    There are no free inodes on the file system
		    on which the symbolic link is being created.

     [EDQUOT]	    The directory in which the entry for the new
		    symbolic link is being placed cannot be
		    extended because the user's quota of disk
		    blocks on the file system containing the
		    directory has been exhausted.

     [EDQUOT]	    The new symbolic link cannot be created
		    because the user's quota of disk blocks on
		    the file system that will contain the sym-
		    bolic link has been exhausted.

     [EDQUOT]	    The user's quota of inodes on the file system
		    on which the symbolic link is being created
		    has been exhausted.

     [EIO]	    An I/O error occurred while making the direc-
		    tory entry or allocating the inode.

     [EFAULT]	    _N_a_m_e_1 or _n_a_m_e_2 points outside the process's
		    allocated address space.
