SIGBLOCK(2)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	      SIGBLOCK(2)



NAME
     sigblock - block signals

SYNOPSIS
     #include <signal.h>

     _o_m_a_s_k = sigblock(_m_a_s_k);
     long _o_m_a_s_k, _m_a_s_k;

     _m_a_s_k = sigmask(_s_i_g_n_u_m)
     long _m_a_s_k;
     int _s_i_g_n_u_m;

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is made obsolete by: sigprocmask(2).

     Sigblock causes the signals specified in _m_a_s_k to be added to
     the set of signals currently being blocked from delivery.
     Signals are blocked if the corresponding bit in _m_a_s_k is a 1;
     the macro sigmask is provided to construct the mask for a
     given _s_i_g_n_u_m.

     It is not possible to block SIGKILL, SIGSTOP, or SIGCONT;
     this restriction is silently imposed by the system.

RETURN VALUE
     The previous set of masked signals is returned.

SEE ALSO
     kill(2), sigprocmask(2), sigaction(2), sigsetmask(2), sig-
     setops(2)

HISTORY
     The sigblock function call appeared in 4.2BSD and has been
     deprecated.
