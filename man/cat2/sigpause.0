NAME
     sigpause - atomically release blocked signals and wait for
     interrupt

SYNOPSIS
     sigpause(_s_i_g_m_a_s_k)
     long _s_i_g_m_a_s_k;

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is made obsolete by: sigsuspend(2).

     Sigpause() assigns _s_i_g_m_a_s_k to the set of masked signals and
     then waits for a signal to arrive; on return the set of
     masked signals is restored.  _S_i_g_m_a_s_k is usually 0L to indi-
     cate that no signals are now to be blocked.  Sigpause always
     terminates by being interrupted, returning -1 with _e_r_r_n_o set
     to EINTR.

SEE ALSO
     sigsuspend(2), kill(2), sigaction(2), sigprocmask(2), sig-
     block(2), sigvec(2)

HISTORY
     The sigpause function call appeared in 4.2BSD and has been
     deprecated.
