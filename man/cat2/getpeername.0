GETPEERNAME(2)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	   GETPEERNAME(2)



NAME
     getpeername - get name of connected peer

SYNOPSIS
     getpeername(s, name, namelen)
     int s;
     struct sockaddr *name;
     int *namelen;

DESCRIPTION
     _G_e_t_p_e_e_r_n_a_m_e returns the name of the peer connected to socket
     _s.  The _n_a_m_e_l_e_n parameter should be initialized to indicate
     the amount of space pointed to by _n_a_m_e.  On return it con-
     tains the actual size of the name returned (in bytes).  The
     name is truncated if the buffer provided is too small.

DIAGNOSTICS
     A 0 is returned if the call succeeds, -1 if it fails.

ERRORS
     The call succeeds unless:

     [EBADF]	    The argument _s is not a valid descriptor.

     [ENOTSOCK]     The argument _s is a file, not a socket.

     [ENOTCONN]     The socket is not connected.

     [ENOBUFS]	    Insufficient resources were available in the
		    system to perform the operation.

     [EFAULT]	    The _n_a_m_e parameter points to memory not in a
		    valid part of the process address space.
