NAME
     rmdir - remove a directory file

SYNOPSIS
     rmdir(path)
     char *path;

DESCRIPTION
     _R_m_d_i_r removes a directory file whose name is given by _p_a_t_h.
     The directory must not have any entries other than "." and
     "..".

RETURN VALUE
     A 0 is returned if the remove succeeds; otherwise a -1 is
     returned and an error code is stored in the global location
     _e_r_r_n_o.

ERRORS
     The named file is removed unless one or more of the follow-
     ing are true:

     [ENOTDIR]	    A component of the path is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]	    The pathname contains a character with the
		    high-order bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A component of a pathname exceeded 255 char-
		    acters, or an entire path name exceeded 1023
		    characters.

     [ENOENT]	    The named directory does not exist.

     [ELOOP]	    Too many symbolic links were encountered in
		    translating the pathname.

     [ENOTEMPTY]    The named directory contains files other than
		    ``.'' and ``..'' in it.

     [EACCES]	    Search permission is denied for a component
		    of the path prefix.

     [EACCES]	    Write permission is denied on the directory
		    containing the link to be removed.

     [EPERM]	    The directory containing the directory to be
		    removed is marked sticky, and neither the
		    containing directory nor the directory to be
		    removed are owned by the effective user ID.

     [EBUSY]	    The directory to be removed is the mount
		    point for a mounted file system.
