LOCK(2)             UNIX Programmer's Manual		  LOCK(2)



NAME
     lock - lock a process in primary memory (2BSD)

SYNOPSIS
     lock(flag)
     int flag

DESCRIPTION
     If the _f_l_a_g argument is non-zero, the process executing this
     call will not be swapped unless it is required to grow.  If
     the argument is zero, the process is un_l_o_c_ked.  This call
     may only be executed by the super-user.

ERRORS
     [EPERM]	    The caller is not the super-user.

BUGS
     _L_o_c_ked processes interfere with the compaction of primary
     memory and can cause deadlock.  This system call is not con-
     sidered a permanent part of the system.

     _L_o_c_k is unique to the PDP-11 and 2BSD; its use is
     discouraged.
