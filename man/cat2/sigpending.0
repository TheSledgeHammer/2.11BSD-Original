NAME
     sigpending - get pending signals

SYNOPSIS
     #include <signal.h>

     _i_n_t
     sigpending(set)
     _s_i_g_s_e_t__t *_s_e_t;

DESCRIPTION
     The sigpending function returns a mask of the signals pend-
     ing for delivery to the calling process in the location
     indicated by _s_e_t.	Signals may be pending because they are
     currently masked, or transiently before delivery (although
     the latter case is not normally detectable).

RETURN VALUES
     A 0 value indicated that the call succeeded.  A -1 return
     value indicates an error occurred and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cated the reason.

ERRORS
     If sigpending fails then _e_r_r_n_o will contain one of the fol-
     lowing:


     [EFAULT]		 _s_e_t contains an invalid address.

SEE ALSO
     sigaction(2), sigprocmask(2)

STANDARDS
     The sigpending function is defined by IEEE Std1003.1-1988
     (``POSIX'').
