NAME
     reboot - reboot system or halt processor

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/reboot.h>

     reboot(howto)
     int howto;

DESCRIPTION
     _R_e_b_o_o_t reboots the system, and is invoked automatically in
     the event of unrecoverable system failures.  _H_o_w_t_o is a mask
     of options passed to the bootstrap program.  The system call
     interface permits only RB_HALT or RB_AUTOBOOT to be passed
     to the reboot program; the other flags are used in scripts
     stored on the console storage media, or used in manual
     bootstrap procedures.  When none of these options (e.g.
     RB_AUTOBOOT) is given, the system is rebooted from file
     "vmunix" in the root file system of unit 0 of a disk chosen
     in a processor specific way.  An automatic consistency check
     of the disks is then normally performed.

     The bits of _h_o_w_t_o are:

     RB_HALT
	  the processor is simply halted; no reboot takes place.
	  RB_HALT should be used with caution.

     RB_ASKNAME
	  Interpreted by the bootstrap program itself, causing it
	  to inquire as to what file should be booted.	Normally,
	  the system is booted from the file "xx(0,0)vmunix"
	  without asking.

     RB_SINGLE
	  Normally, the reboot procedure involves an automatic
	  disk consistency check and then multi-user operations.
	  RB_SINGLE prevents the consistency check, rather simply
	  booting the system with a single-user shell on the con-
	  sole.  RB_SINGLE is interpreted by the _i_n_i_t(8) program
	  in the newly booted system.  This switch is not avail-
	  able from the system call interface.

     Only the super-user may _r_e_b_o_o_t a machine.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, this call never returns.  Otherwise, a -1 is
     returned and an error is returned in the global variable
     _e_r_r_n_o.

ERRORS
     [EPERM]	    The caller is not the super-user.

BUGS
     The notion of ``console medium'', among other things, is
     specific to the VAX.
