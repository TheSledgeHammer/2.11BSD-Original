SIGSETMASK(2)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	    SIGSETMASK(2)



NAME
     sigsetmask - set current signal mask

SYNOPSIS
     #include <signal.h>

     omask = sigsetmask(mask);
     long omask, mask;

     mask = sigmask(signum)
     long mask;
     int signum;

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is made obsolete by:

     _S_i_g_s_e_t_m_a_s_k sets the current signal mask (those signals that
     are blocked from delivery).  Signals are blocked if the
     corresponding bit in _m_a_s_k is a 1; the macro _s_i_g_m_a_s_k is pro-
     vided to construct the mask for a given _s_i_g_n_u_m.

     The system quietly disallows SIGKILL, SIGSTOP, or SIGCONT to
     be blocked.

RETURN VALUE
     The previous set of masked signals is returned.

SEE ALSO
     kill(2), sigvec(2), sigblock(2), sigpause(2)

HISTORY
     The sigsetmask function call appeared in 4.2BSD and has been
     deprecated.
