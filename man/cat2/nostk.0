NAME
     nostk - allow process to manage its own stack (2BSD)

SYNOPSYS
     nostk();

DESCRIPTION
     _N_o_s_t_k informs the system that the process wishes to manage
     its own stack.  The system releases the stack segment(s) it
     has reserved, making them available for allocation (via
     _b_r_k(2)) by the user.

     C programs should use _n_o_s_t_k only with great caution and
     understanding of the C language calling and stack conven-
     tions.  It is most useful for assembler programs that want
     to use the entire available address space.

SEE ALSO
     stack(5)

BUGS
     _N_o_s_t_k is unique to the PDP-11 and 2BSD; its use is
     discouraged.
