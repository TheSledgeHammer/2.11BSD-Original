NAME
     chdir, fchdir - change current working directory

SYNOPSIS
     chdir(path)
     char *path;

     fchdir(fd)
     int fd;

DESCRIPTION
     The path argument points to the pathname of a directory.
     The fd argument is a file descriptor which references a
     directory.  The _c_h_d_i_r function causes this directory to
     become the current working directory, the starting point for
     path names not beginning with ``/''.

     The _f_c_h_d_i_r function causes the directory referenced by fd to
     become the current working directory, the starting point for
     path searches of pathnames not beginning with a slahs, '/'.

     In order for a directory to become the current directory, a
     process must have execute (search) access to the directory.

RETURN VALUE
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Oth-
     erwise, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cate the error.

ERRORS
     _C_h_d_i_r will fail and the current working directory will be
     unchanged if one or more of the following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]	    A component of the path prefix is not a
		    directory.

     [EINVAL]	    The pathname contains a character with the
		    high-order bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A component of a pathname exceeded 63 charac-
		    ters, or an entire path name exceeded 255
		    characters.

     [ENOENT]	    The named directory does not exist.

     [ELOOP]	    Too many symbolic links were encountered in
		    translating the pathname.

     [EACCES]	    Search permission is denied for any component
		    of the path name.

     [EFAULT]	    _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated
