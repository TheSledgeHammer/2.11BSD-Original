NAME
     chflags, fchflags - set file flags

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/stat.h>

     int
     chflags(path, flags)
     char *path;
     u_short flags;

     int
     fchflags(fd, flags)
     int fd;
     u_short flags;

DESCRIPTION
     The file whose name is given by path or referenced by the
     descriptor fd has its flags changed to flags .

     The flags specified are formed by or'ing the following
     values

     UF_NODUMP	    Do not dump the file.

     UF_IMMUTABLE   The file may not be changed.

     UF_APPEND	    The file may only be appended to.

     ARCHIVED	    File is archived.

     SF_IMMUTABLE   The file may not be changed.

     SF_APPEND	    The file may only be appended to.

     The UF_IMMUTABLE and UF_APPEND flags may be set or unset by
     either the owner of a file or the super-user.

     The SF_IMMUTABLE and SF_APPEND flags may only be set or
     unset by the super-user.  They may be set at any time, but
     normally may only be unset when the system is in single-user
     mode.  (See _i_n_i_t(_8) for details.)

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Oth-
     erwise, -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set
     to indicate the error.

     EROFS	    The named file resides on a read-only file
		    system.

     EFAULT	    path points outside the process's allocated
		    address space.

     EBADF	    The descriptor is not valid.

     EINVAL	    fd refers to a socket, not to a file.

     EPERM	    The effective user ID does not match the
