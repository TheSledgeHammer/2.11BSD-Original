GETPGRP(2)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       GETPGRP(2)



NAME
     getpgrp - get process group

SYNOPSIS
     pgrp = getpgrp(pid)
     int pgrp;
     int pid;

DESCRIPTION
     The process group of the specified process is returned by
     _g_e_t_p_g_r_p. If _p_i_d is zero, then the call applies to the
     current process.

     Process groups are used for distribution of signals, and by
     terminals to arbitrate requests for their input: processes
     that have the same process group as the terminal are fore-
     ground and may read, while others will block with a signal
     if they attempt to read.

     This call is thus used by programs such as _c_s_h(1) to create
     process groups in implementing job control.  The TIOCGPGRP
     and TIOCSPGRP calls described in _t_t_y(4) are used to get/set
     the process group of the control terminal.
