NAME
     setreuid - set real and effective user ID's

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     _i_n_t
     setreuid(ruid, euid)
	 uid_t ruid, euid

DESCRIPTION
     The real and effective user IDs of the current process are
     set according to the arguments.  If _r_u_i_d or _e_u_i_d is -1, the
     current uid is filled in by the system.  Unprivileged users
     may change the real user ID to the effective user ID and
     vice-versa; only the super-user may make other changes.

     The setreuid function has been used to swap the real and
     effective user IDs in set-user-ID programs to temporarily
     relinquish the set-user-ID value.	This purpose is now
     better served by the use of the seteuid function (see
     setuid(2)).

     When setting the real and effective user IDs to the same
     value, the standard setuid function is preferred.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Oth-
     erwise, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cate the error.

ERRORS
     EPERM     The current process is not the super-user and a
	       change other than changing the effective user-id
	       to the real user-id was specified.

SEE ALSO
     getuid(2), seteuid(2), setuid(2)

HISTORY
     The setreuid function call appeared in 4.2BSD and was
     dropped in 4.4BSD.
