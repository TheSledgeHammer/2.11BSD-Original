NAME
     socketpair - create a pair of connected sockets

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/socket.h>

     socketpair(d, type, protocol, sv)
     int d, type, protocol;
     int sv[2];

DESCRIPTION
     The _s_o_c_k_e_t_p_a_i_r call creates an unnamed pair of connected
     sockets in the specified domain _d, of the specified _t_y_p_e,
     and using the optionally specified _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l.  The descrip-
     tors used in referencing the new sockets are returned in
     _s_v[0] and _s_v[1].  The two sockets are indistinguishable.

DIAGNOSTICS
     A 0 is returned if the call succeeds, -1 if it fails.

ERRORS
     The call succeeds unless:

     [EMFILE]		 Too many descriptors are in use by this
			 process.

     [EAFNOSUPPORT]	 The specified address family is not sup-
			 ported on this machine.

     [EPROTONOSUPPORT]	 The specified protocol is not supported
			 on this machine.

     [EOPNOSUPPORT]	 The specified protocol does not support
			 creation of socket pairs.

     [EFAULT]		 The address _s_v does not specify a valid
			 part of the process address space.

SEE ALSO
     read(2), write(2), pipe(2)

BUGS
     This call is currently implemented only for the UNIX domain.
