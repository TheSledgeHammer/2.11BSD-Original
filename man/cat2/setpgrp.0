NAME
     setpgrp - set process group

SYNOPSIS
     setpgrp(pid, pgrp)
     int pid, pgrp;

DESCRIPTION
     _S_e_t_p_g_r_p sets the process group of the specified process _p_i_d
     to the specified _p_g_r_p.  If _p_i_d is zero, then the call
     applies to the current process.

     If the invoker is not the super-user, then the affected pro-
     cess must have the same effective user-id as the invoker or
     be a descendant of the invoking process.

RETURN VALUE
     _S_e_t_p_g_r_p returns when the operation was successful.  If the
     request failed, -1 is returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o
     indicates the reason.

ERRORS
     _S_e_t_p_g_r_p will fail and the process group will not be altered
     if one of the following occur:

     [ESRCH]	    The requested process does not exist.

     [EPERM]	    The effective user ID of the requested pro-
		    cess is different from that of the caller and
		    the process is not a descendent of the cal-
		    ling process.
