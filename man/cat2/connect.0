CONNECT(2)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       CONNECT(2)



NAME
     connect - initiate a connection on a socket

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/socket.h>

     connect(s, name, namelen)
     int s;
     struct sockaddr *name;
     int namelen;

DESCRIPTION
     The parameter _s is a socket.  If it is of type SOCK_DGRAM,
     then this call specifies the peer with which the socket is
     to be associated; this address is that to which datagrams
     are to be sent, and the only address from which datagrams
     are to be received.  If the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM,
     then this call attempts to make a connection to another
     socket.  The other socket is specified by _n_a_m_e, which is an
     address in the communications space of the socket.  Each
     communications space interprets the _n_a_m_e parameter in its
     own way.  Generally, stream sockets may successfully _c_o_n_n_e_c_t
     only once; datagram sockets may use _c_o_n_n_e_c_t multiple times
     to change their association.  Datagram sockets may dissolve
     the association by connecting to an invalid address, such as
     a null address.

RETURN VALUE
     If the connection or binding succeeds, then 0 is returned.
     Otherwise a -1 is returned, and a more specific error code
     is stored in _e_r_r_n_o.

ERRORS
     The call fails if:

     [EBADF]		 _S is not a valid descriptor.

     [ENOTSOCK]          _S is a descriptor for a file, not a
			 socket.

     [EADDRNOTAVAIL]	 The specified address is not available
			 on this machine.

     [EAFNOSUPPORT]	 Addresses in the specified address fam-
			 ily cannot be used with this socket.

     [EISCONN]		 The socket is already connected.

     [ETIMEDOUT]	 Connection establishment timed out
			 without establishing a connection.

     [ECONNREFUSED]	 The attempt to connect was forcefully
			 rejected.

     [ENETUNREACH]	 The network isn't reachable from this
			 host.

     [EADDRINUSE]	 The address is already in use.

     [EFAULT]		 The _n_a_m_e parameter specifies an area
			 outside the process address space.

     [EINPROGRESS]	 The socket is non-blocking and the con-
			 nection cannot be completed immediately.
			 It is possible to _s_e_l_e_c_t(2) for comple-
			 tion by selecting the socket for writ-
			 ing.

     [EALREADY]          The socket is non-blocking and a previ-
			 ous connection attempt has not yet been
			 completed.

     The following errors are specific to connecting names in the
     UNIX domain.  These errors may not apply in future versions
     of the UNIX IPC domain.

     [ENOTDIR]	    A component of the path prefix is not a
		    directory.

     [EINVAL]	    The pathname contains a character with the
		    high-order bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A component of a pathname exceeded 255 char-
		    acters, or an entire path name exceeded 1023
		    characters.

     [ENOENT]	    The named socket does not exist.

     [EACCES]	    Search permission is denied for a component
		    of the path prefix.

     [EACCES]	    Write access to the named socket is denied.

     [ELOOP]	    Too many symbolic links were encountered in
		    translating the pathname.
