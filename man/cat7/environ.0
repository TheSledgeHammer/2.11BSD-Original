NAME
     environ - user environment

SYNOPSIS
     extern char **environ;

DESCRIPTION
     An array of strings called the `environment' is made avail-
     able by _e_x_e_c_v_e(2) when a process begins.  By convention
     these strings have the form `_n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e'.	The following
     names are used by various commands:

     PATH    The sequence of directory prefixes that _s_h, _t_i_m_e,
	     _n_i_c_e(1), etc., apply in searching for a file known
	     by an incomplete path name.  The prefixes are
	     separated by `:'.	_L_o_g_i_n(1) sets
	     PATH=:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin.

     HOME    A user's login directory, set by _l_o_g_i_n(1) from the
	     password file _p_a_s_s_w_d(5).

     TERM    The kind of terminal for which output is to be
	     prepared.	This information is used by commands,
	     such as _n_r_o_f_f or _p_l_o_t(1G), which may exploit special
	     terminal capabilities.  See /_e_t_c/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p
	     (_t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5)) for a list of terminal types.

     SHELL   The file name of the users login shell.

     TERMCAP The string describing the terminal in TERM, or the
	     name of the termcap file, see
	     _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5),_t_e_r_m_c_a_p(3X).

     EXINIT  A startup list of commands read by _e_x(1), _e_d_i_t(1),
	     and _v_i(1).

     USER    The login name of the user.

     PRINTER The name of the default printer to be used by
	     _l_p_r(1), _l_p_q(1), and _l_p_r_m(1).

     Further names may be placed in the environment by the _e_x_p_o_r_t
     command and `name=value' arguments in _s_h(1), or by the
     _s_e_t_e_n_v command if you use _c_s_h(1).	Arguments may also be
     placed in the environment at the point of an _e_x_e_c_v_e(2).  It
     is unwise to conflict with certain _s_h(1) variables that are
     frequently exported by `.profile' files: MAIL, PS1, PS2,
     IFS.
