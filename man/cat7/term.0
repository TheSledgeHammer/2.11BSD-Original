     The list goes on and on.  Consult /etc/termcap (see
     _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5)) for an up-to-date and locally correct list.

     Commands whose behavior may depend on the terminal either
     consult TERM in the environment, or accept arguments of the
     form -Tterm, where _t_e_r_m is one of the names given above.
