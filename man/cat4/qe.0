NAME
     qe - DEC DEQNA Q-bus 10 Mb/s Ethernet interface

SYNOPSIS
     /sys/conf/SYSTEM:
	  NQE  _q_e__c_o_n_t_r_o_l_l_e_r_s # DEQNA

DESCRIPTION
     The qe interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet net-
     work through the DEC DEQNA Q-bus controller.

     Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot
     time with an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl.  The qe interface employs
     the address resolution protocol described in arp(4P) to map
     dynamically  between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the
     local network.

     The interface normally tries to use a ``trailer'' encapsula-
     tion to minimize copying data on input and output.  The use
     of trailers is negotiated with ARP.  This negotiation may be
     disabled, on a per-interface basis, by setting the
     IFF_NOTRAILERS flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.
