DESCRIPTION
     The _D_i_g_i_t_a_l _E_q_u_i_p_m_e_n_t _1_9_8_1-_8_2 _P_e_r_i_p_h_e_r_a_l_s _H_a_n_d_b_o_o_k states
     the following about the DR11-W:

	  The The DR11-W is a general purpose, direct memory
	  access (DMA) interface to the PDP-11 UNIBUS or VAX
	  UNIBUS.  The DR11-W moves data directly between memory
	  and the UNIBUS to and from the user's peripheral.

	  It features:

	  o+    Word or byte transfers.

	  o+    Programmed or direct memory access (DMA) block
	       transfers.

	  o+    Burst data transfers.

	  o+    User-controlled transfer rates up to memory speed.

	  The DR11-W is a 53-line direct memory access (DMA)
	  interface to the PDP-11 UNIBUS or VAX UBA, which allows
	  the user to control data transfers between the host
	  processor and a peripheral.  The DR11-W has 32 data
	  lines (for transferring 16-bit parallel data) and 21
	  control lines (for transferring control and status
	  information.

	  When used as an interprocessor buffer (IPB), the DR11-W
	  allows data transfers between two processors.  Inter-
	  processor communication is accomplished by attaching
	  one DR11-W to each processor UNIBUS or UBA and then
	  cabling the two DR11-Ws together.

     There.  Now you know as much about it as I do.

     A number of _i_o_c_t_l(2) calls apply to the dr devices, and have
     the form
	  #include <pdpuba/drreg.h>
	  ioctl(fildes, code, arg)
	  int *arg;
     The applicable codes are:

     DRGTTY	       Get DR11-W status.

     DRSTTY	       Set flags and function.

     DRSFUN	       Set function.

     DRSFLAG	       Set flags.

     DRGCSR	       Get CSR and WCR.

     DRSSIG	       Set signal for ATTN interrupt.

     DRESET	       Reset DR11-W interface.

     DRSTIME	       Set timeout.

     DRCTIME	       Set timeout inactive.

     DROUTPUT	       Put word in output data register.

     DRINPUT	       Get word from input data register.

     DRITIME	       Don't ignore errors on timeout.

FILES
     /dev/dr[0-7]	 device special files
     /dev/MAKEDEV	 script to create special files
     /dev/MAKEDEV.local  script to localize special files

DIAGNOSTICS
     dr%d: error csr=%b, eir=%b

     dr%d: timeout error

BUGS
     This interface is only available under 2.9BSD and 2.11BSD.
     No documentation exists on how to use it.
