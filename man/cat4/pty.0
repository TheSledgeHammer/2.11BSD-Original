NAME
     pty - pseudo terminal driver

SYNOPSIS
     /sys/conf/SYSTEM:
	  NPTY _p_t_y_s # pseudo-terminals, in groups of 8

DESCRIPTION
     The _p_t_y driver provides support for a device-pair termed a
     _p_s_e_u_d_o _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l.  A pseudo terminal is a pair of character
     devices, a _m_a_s_t_e_r device and a _s_l_a_v_e device.  The slave dev-
     ice provides processes an interface identical to that
     described in _t_t_y(4).  However, whereas all other devices
     which provide the interface described in _t_t_y(4) have a
     hardware device of some sort behind them, the slave device
     has, instead, another process manipulating it through the
     master half of the pseudo terminal.  That is, anything writ-
     ten on the master device is given to the slave device as
     input and anything written on the slave device is presented
     as input on the master device.

     In configuring, _p_t_y_s specifies the number of pseudo terminal
     pairs are configured.

     The following _i_o_c_t_l calls apply only to pseudo terminals:

     TIOCSTOP
	  Stops output to a terminal (e.g. like typing ^S).
	  Takes no parameter.

     TIOCSTART
	  Restarts output (stopped by TIOCSTOP or by typing ^S).
	  Takes no parameter.

     TIOCPKT
	  Enable/disable _p_a_c_k_e_t mode.  Packet mode is enabled by
	  specifying (by reference) a nonzero parameter and dis-
	  abled by specifying (by reference) a zero parameter.
	  When applied to the master side of a pseudo terminal,
	  each subsequent _r_e_a_d from the terminal will return data
	  written on the slave part of the pseudo terminal pre-
	  ceded by a zero byte (symbolically defined as
	  TIOCPKT_DATA), or a single byte reflecting control
	  status information.  In the latter case, the byte is an
	  inclusive-or of zero or more of the bits:

	  TIOCPKT_FLUSHREAD
	       whenever the read queue for the terminal is
	       flushed.

	  TIOCPKT_FLUSHWRITE
	       whenever the write queue for the terminal is

	       flushed.

	  TIOCPKT_STOP
	       whenever output to the terminal is stopped a la
	       ^S.

	  TIOCPKT_START
	       whenever output to the terminal is restarted.

	  TIOCPKT_DOSTOP
	       whenever _t__s_t_o_p_c is ^S and _t__s_t_a_r_t_c is ^Q.

	  TIOCPKT_NOSTOP
	       whenever the start and stop characters are not
	       ^S/^Q.

	  While this mode is in use, the presence of control
	  status information to be read from the master side may
	  be detected by a _s_e_l_e_c_t for exceptional conditions.

	  This mode is used by _r_l_o_g_i_n(1C) and _r_l_o_g_i_n_d(8C) to
	  implement a remote-echoed, locally ^S/^Q flow-
	  controlled remote login with proper back-flushing of
	  output; it can be used by other similar programs.

     TIOCUCNTL
	  Enable/disable a mode that allows a small number of
	  simple user _i_o_c_t_l commands to be passed through the
	  pseudo-terminal, using a protocol similar to that of
	  TIOCPKT.  The TIOCUCNTL and TIOCPKT modes are mutually
	  exclusive.  This mode is enabled from the master side
	  of a pseudo terminal by specifying (by reference) a
	  nonzero parameter and disabled by specifying (by refer-
	  ence) a zero parameter.  Each subsequent _r_e_a_d from the
	  master side will return data written on the slave part
	  of the pseudo terminal preceded by a zero byte, or a
	  single byte reflecting a user control operation on the
	  slave side.  A user control command consists of a spe-
	  cial _i_o_c_t_l operation with no data; the command is given
	  as UIOCCMD(_n), where _n is a number in the range 1-255.
	  The operation value _n will be received as a single byte
	  on the next _r_e_a_d from the master side.  The _i_o_c_t_l
	  UIOCCMD(0) is a no-op that may be used to probe for the
	  existence of this facility.  As with TIOCPKT mode, com-
	  mand operations may be detected with a _s_e_l_e_c_t for
	  exceptional conditions.

     TIOCREMOTE
	  A mode for the master half of a pseudo terminal,
	  independent of TIOCPKT.  This mode causes input to the
	  pseudo terminal to be flow controlled and not input
	  edited (regardless of the terminal mode).  Each write

	  to the control terminal produces a record boundary for
	  the process reading the terminal.  In normal usage, a
	  write of data is like the data typed as a line on the
	  terminal; a write of 0 bytes is like typing an end-of-
	  file character.  TIOCREMOTE can be used when doing
	  remote line editing in a window manager, or whenever
	  flow controlled input is required.
