NAME
     vv - Proteon proNET 10 Megabit ring

SYNOPSIS
     /sys/conf/SYSTEM:
	  NVV  _v_v__c_o_n_t_r_o_l_l_e_r_s # V2LNI (Pronet)

DESCRIPTION
     The _v_v interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Proteon proNET
     ring network.

     The network address of the interface must be specified with
     an an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl before data can be transmitted or
     received.	It is only permissible to change the network
     address while the interface is marked "down".

     The host's hardware address is discovered by putting the
     interface in digital loopback mode (not joining the ring)
     and sending a broadcast packet from which the hardware
     address is extracted.

     Transmit timeouts are detected through use of a watchdog
     routine.  Lost input interrupts are checked for when packets
     are sent out.

     If the installation is running CTL boards which use the old
     broadcast address of 0 instead of the new address of 0xff,
     the define OLD_BROADCAST should be specified in the driver.

     The driver can use ``trailer'' encapsulation to minimize
     copying data on input and output.	This may be disabled, on
     a per-interface basis, by setting the IFF_NOTRAILERS flag
     with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.

DIAGNOSTICS
     vv%d: host %d.  The software announces the host address
     discovered during autoconfiguration.

     vv%d: can't initialize. The software was unable to discover
     the address of this interface, so it deemed "dead" will not
     be enabled.

     vv%d: error vvocsr=%b.  The hardware indicated an error on
     the previous transmission.

     vv%d: output timeout.  The token timer has fired and the
     token will be recreated.

     vv%d: error vvicsr=%b.  The hardware indicated an error in
     reading a packet off the ring.

     en%d: can't handle af%d.  The interface was handed a message
     with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address family;
     the packet was dropped.

     vv%d: vs_olen=%d.	The ring output routine has been handed a
     message with a preposterous length.  This results in an
     immediate _p_a_n_i_c: _v_s__o_l_e_n.

BUGS
     The encapsulation of trailer packets in the 4.2BSD version
     of this driver was incorrect (the packet type was in VAX
     byte order).  As a result, the trailer encapsulation in this
     version is not compatible with the 4.2BSD VAX version.
