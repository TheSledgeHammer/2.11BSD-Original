NAME
     ts - TS-11 magtape interface

SYNOPSIS
     /sys/conf/SYSTEM:
	  NTS  _t_s__d_r_i_v_e_s      # TS11

     /etc/dtab:
	  #Name Unit# Addr   Vector Br Handler(s)      # Comments
	  ts	?     172520 224    5  tsintr	       # ts11 driver

     major device number(s):
	  raw: 8
	  block: 2
     minor device encoding:
	  bits 0003 specify TS drive
	  bit  0004 specifies no-rewind operation
	  bit  0010 ignored

DESCRIPTION
     The ts-11 combination provides a standard tape drive inter-
     face as described in _m_t_i_o(4).  The ts-11 operates only at
     1600 bpi, and only one transport is possible per controller.

FILES
     /dev/MAKEDEV	 script to create special files
     /dev/MAKEDEV.local  script to localize special files

SEE ALSO
     mt(1), tar(1), tp(1), mtio(4), ht(4), tm(4), dtab(5), auto-
     config(8)

DIAGNOSTICS
     ts%d: no write ring.  An attempt was made to write on the
     tape drive when no write ring was present; this message is
     written on the terminal of the user who tried to access the
     tape.

     ts%d: not online.	An attempt was made to access the tape
     while it was offline; this message is written on the termi-
     nal of the user who tried to access the tape.

     ts%d: hard error bn%d xs0=%b xs1=%b xs2=%b xs3=%b.  A hard
     error occurred on the tape at block _b_n; status registers 0-3
     are printed in octal and symbolically decoded as bits.

     ts%d: addr mod 4 != 0.  The address of a TS-11 command
     packet was not on an even longword boundary.

BUGS
     If any non-data error is encountered on non-raw tape, it
     refuses to do anything more until closed.

     The device lives at the same address as a tm-11 _t_m(4).
