DESCRIPTION
     Tape controllers compatible with the DEC Tape Mass Storage
     Control Protocol (TMSCP) architecture such as the TU81 and
     the TK50 provide a standard tape drive interface as
     described in _m_t_i_o(4).  The controller communicates with the
     host through a packet oriented protocol.  Consult the file
     <pdp/tmscp.h> for a detailed description of this protocol.

FILES
     /dev/MAKEDEV	 script to create special files
     /dev/MAKEDEV.local  script to localize special files

     The vector specified in /etc/dtab may be given as an expli-
     cit value in which case _a_u_t_o_c_o_n_f_i_g(_8) will attempt to allo-
     cate the specified vector.  The vector may also be (if the
     system is at revision level 100 or higher) given as 0 - in
     which case _a_u_t_o_c_o_n_f_i_g(_8) will request the kernel to allocate
     the next available vector (beginning at 01000 and proceeding
     downward) which _a_u_t_o_c_o_n_f_i_g(_8) will initialize.

     Multiple drives on a single controller are supported.  Mul-
     tiple controllers are also supported.

     Density selection is specified by bits 3 and 4 in the minor
     device number.  A value of 0 requests the lowest density of
     a drive and a value of 3 the highest density.  Values of 1
     and 2 are essentially equivalent (because because TMSCP only
     defines values for three densities) and request the middle
     density (for tri-density tape drives).

DIAGNOSTICS
     tms: !drives.  Not enough drives were declared when the ker-
     nel was built.  The NTMS parameter in the kernel config file
     needs to be increased by at least one.

     tms%d stepN init failed: sa %x.  Step N of the 4 step ini-
     tialization sequence has failed.

     tms%d: random intr.  An unexpected interrupt was received.
     This is indicative of some other device using the same
     interrupt vector as the TMSCP controller.	The interrupt is
     ignored.

     tms%d Ver %d Mod %d.  The version and model number of the
     controller are displayed when the controller is initialized.
     This is an information message and not an error.

     tms%d: state %d.  The controller state is not one of the 4
     initialization states or the RUN state.  This indicates a
     serious problem in the driver and possibly the hardware.

     tms%d:  fatal error %x.  The controller detected a ``fatal
     error'' in the status returned to the host.  The contents of
     the status register are displayed.

     tms%d init fail.  The controller failed to initialize.
     Indicative of a hardware problem.

     tms%d,%d flush fail.  The cache failed to flush during a
     close operation.  Data loss is possible in this case.

     tms%d,%d: sa %x state %d.	A fatal error.	The controller
     will be reset in an attempt to resume operation.

     tms ioctl.  An invalid internal ioctl function call has been
     made.  This is a driver bug.

     tms%d,%d inv end.	An invalid end (completion) code has been
     detected.	A drive has returned 0 as the opcode originally
     issued.  This is a hardware problem.

     tms%d,%d bad rsp: %x.  An unrecognized response has been
     received.	This is a driver bug.

     tms%d,%d cache lost The cache on the drive has been lost.
     Data loss is likely.  Usually due to a hardware problem.

     The following error is produced when a TMSCP error log
     datagram is received:

     tms%d,%d dgram fmt=%x evt=%x grp=%x flg=%x pos=%D.

     Earlier versions of the driver consumed a noticeable amount
     of kernel D-space decoding and pretty printing more detailed
     information.  This has been removed in favor of a shorter
     message.  In the future an error log daemon will be written
     and the datagrams from the MSCP and TMSCP drivers passed to
     it for analysis.

BUGS
     If any non-data error is encountered on non-raw tape, it
     refuses to do anything more until closed.

     On quad-density tape drives (the Kennedy 9662 for example)
     the middle density of 3200bpi is not host selectable (it can
     be manually selected from the drive's front panel) because
     TMSCP only defines 800, 1600 and 6250bpi.
