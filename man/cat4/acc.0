NAME
     acc - ACC LH/DH IMP interface

SYNOPSIS
     /sys/conf/SYSTEM:
	  NACC 0    # ACC LH/DH ARPAnet IMP interface
	  PLI  YES  # LH/DH is connected to a PLI

DESCRIPTION
     The _a_c_c device provides a Local Host/Distant Host interface
     to an IMP.  It is normally used when participating in the
     DARPA Internet.  The controller itself is not accessible to
     users, but instead provides the hardware support to the IMP
     interface described in _i_m_p(4).  When configuring, the
     _i_m_p(_N_I_M_P) pseudo-device must also be included.

DIAGNOSTICS
     acc%d: not alive.	The initialization routine was entered
     even though the device did not autoconfigure.  This indi-
     cates a system problem.

     acc%d: can't initialize.  Insufficient UNIBUS resources
     existed to initialize the device.	This is likely to occur
     when the device is run on a buffered data path on an 11/750
     and other network interfaces are also configured to use buf-
     fered data paths, or when it is configured to use buffered
     data paths on an 11/730 (which has none).

     acc%d: imp doesn't respond, icsr=%b.  The driver attempted
     to initialize the device, but the IMP failed to respond
     after 500 tries.  Check the cabling.

     acc%d: stray xmit interrupt, csr=%b.  An interrupt occurred
     when no output had previously been started.

     acc%d: output error, ocsr=%b, icsr=%b.  The device indicated
     a problem sending data on output.

     acc%d: input error, csr=%b.  The device indicated a problem
     receiving data on input.

     acc%d: bad length=%d.  An input operation resulted in a data
     transfer of less than 0 or more than 1008 bytes of data into
     memory (according to the word count register).  This should
     never happen as the maximum size of a host-IMP message is
     1008 bytes.
