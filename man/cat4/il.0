NAME
     il - Interlan NI1010 10 Mb/s Ethernet interface

SYNOPSIS
     /sys/conf/SYSTEM:
	  NIL  _i_l__c_o_n_t_r_o_l_l_e_r_s # Interlan Ethernet

DESCRIPTION
     The _i_l interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet net-
     work through an Interlan 1010 or 1010A controller.

     Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot
     time with an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl.  The _i_l interface employs
     the address resolution protocol described in _a_r_p(4P) to
     dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on
     the local network.

     The interface normally tries to use a ``trailer'' encapsula-
     tion to minimize copying data on input and output.  The use
     of trailers is negotiated with ARP.  This negotiation may be
     disabled, on a per-interface basis, by setting the
     IFF_NOTRAILERS flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.

DIAGNOSTICS
     il%d: input error.  The hardware indicated an error in read-
     ing a packet off the cable or an illegally sized packet.

     il%d: can't handle af%d.  The interface was handed a message
     with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address family;
     the packet was dropped.

     il%d: setaddr didn't work.  The interface was unable to
     reprogram its physical ethernet address.  This may happen
     with very early models of the interface.  This facility is
     used only when the controller is not the first network
     interface configured for XNS.  The oldest interface tested
     (2.7.1.0.1.45) has never failed in this way.

     The following messages indicate a probable hardware error
     performing the indicated operation during autoconfiguration
     or initialization.  The status field in the control and
     status register (the low-order four bits) should indicate
     the nature of the failure.  See the hardware manual for
     details.

     il%d: reset failed, csr=%b.

     il%d: status failed, csr=%b.

     il%d: hardware diag failed, csr=%b.
