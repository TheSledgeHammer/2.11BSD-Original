NAME
     tm - TM-11/TE-10 magtape interface

SYNOPSIS
     /sys/conf/SYSTEM:
	  # Setting AVIVTM configures the TM driver for the AVIV 800/1600/6250
	  # controller.  For more details, see /sys/pdpuba/tm.c.
	  NTM	 _t_m__d_r_i_v_e_s # TM11
	  AVIVTM _Y_E_S	   # AVIV 800/1600/6250 controller

     /etc/dtab:
	  #Name Unit# Addr   Vector Br Handler(s)      # Comments
	  tm	?     172520 224    5  tmintr	       # tm11 driver

     major device number(s):
	  raw: 7
	  block: 1
     minor device encoding:
	  bits 0003 specify TS drive
	  bit  0004 specifies no-rewind operation
	  bits 0030 specify recording density:
	       0000:   800BPI
	       0010:  1600BPI (AVIVTM and some other controllers)
	       0020:  6250BPI (AVIVTM only)

DESCRIPTION
     The tm-11/te-10 combination provides a standard tape drive
     interface as described in _m_t_i_o(4).  The standard DEC tm-11
     operates only at 800 bpi.	Other controllers of this type
     may also allow operation at 1600 bpi, under software control
     or by switching manually.

FILES
     /dev/MAKEDEV	 script to create special files
     /dev/MAKEDEV.local  script to localize special files

     autoconfig(8)

DIAGNOSTICS
     te%d: no write ring.  An attempt was made to write on the
     tape drive when no write ring was present; this message is
     written on the terminal of the user who tried to access the
     tape.

     te%d: not online.	An attempt was made to access the tape
     while it was offline; this message is written on the termi-
     nal of the user who tried to access the tape.

     te%d: can't change density in mid-tape.  An attempt was made
     to write on a tape at a different density than is already

     recorded on the tape.  This message is written on the termi-
     nal of the user who tried to switch the density.

     te%d: hard error bn%d er=%b.   A tape error occurred at
     block _b_n; the tm error register is printed in octal with the
     bits symbolically decoded.  Any error is fatal on non-raw
     tape; when possible the driver will have retried the opera-
     tion which failed several times before reporting the error.

     te%d: lost interrupt.  A tape operation did not complete
     within a reasonable time, most likely because the tape was
     taken off-line during rewind or lost vacuum.  The controller
     should, but does not, give an interrupt in these cases.  The
     device will be made available again after this message, but
     any current open reference to the device will return an
     error as the operation in progress aborts.

BUGS
     If any non-data error is encountered on non-raw tape, it
     refuses to do anything more until closed.
