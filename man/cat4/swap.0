NAME
     swap - swap device

DESCRIPTION
     This file refers to the swap device in use by the system.
     It should be linked to the special file for the disk or disk
     partition on which the system swaps.  It is used by programs
     that wish to read from the swap device without knowing its
     real name.  The script /_d_e_v/_M_A_K_E_D_E_V._l_o_c_a_l normally is edited
     by the system builder to set /_d_e_v/_s_w_a_p up correctly.

FILES
     /dev/swap
     /dev/MAKEDEV	 script to create special files
     /dev/MAKEDEV.local  script to localize special files
