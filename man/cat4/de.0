NAME
     de - DEC DEUNA 10 Mb/s Ethernet interface

SYNOPSIS
     /sys/conf/SYSTEM:
	  NDE  _d_e__c_o_n_t_r_o_l_l_e_r_s # DEUNA

DESCRIPTION
     The _d_e interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet net-
     work through a Digital Equipment UNIBUS Network Adapter
     (DEUNA).

     Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot
     time with an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl.  The _d_e interface employs
     the address resolution protocol described in _a_r_p(4P) to
     dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on
     the local network.

     The interface normally tries to use a ``trailer'' encapsula-
     tion to minimize copying data on input and output.  The use
     of trailers is negotiated with ARP.  This negotiation may be
     disabled, on a per-interface basis, by setting the
     IFF_NOTRAILERS flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.

DIAGNOSTICS
     de%d: hardware address %s.  This is a normal autoconfigura-
     tion message noting the 6 byte physical ethernet address of
     the adapter.

     de%d: oerror, flags=%b tdrerr=%b (len=%d).  The hardware
     indicated an error in transmitting a packet to the cable.
     The status and error flags are reported.

     de%d: ierror, flags=%b lenerr=%b (len=%d).  The hardware
     indicated an error in reading a packet from the cable.  The
     status and error flags are reported.

     de%d: can't handle af%d.  The interface was handed a message
     with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address family;
     the packet was dropped.

     de%d: buffer unavailable.	The interface received more pack-
     ets than it had buffers allocated to receive them.

     de%d: address change failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.  The interface
     was unable to reprogram its physical ethernet address.  This
     may happen with very early models of the interface.  This
     facility is used only when the controller is not the first
     network interface configured for XNS.

     The following messages indicate a probable hardware error
     performing the indicated operation during autoconfiguration

     or initialization.  The two control and status registers
     should indicate the nature of the failure.  See the hardware
     manual for details.

     de%d: reset failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.

     de%d: ppcb failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.

     de%d: read addr failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.

     de%d: wtring failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.

     de%d: wtmode failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
