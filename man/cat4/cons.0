NAME
     cons - PDP-11 console interface

DESCRIPTION
     The console is available to the processor through the con-
     sole registers.  It acts like a normal terminal, except that
     typing control-P on the consoles of some PDP-11's puts the
     console in local console mode with an ODT (console debugger
     mode) prompt.  The operation of the console in this mode
     varies per-processor.  See the PDP-11 Processor Handbook for
     your particular processor.

     On an 11/44 the console can be put into local mode by typing
     a control-P.  The ODT prompt is ``>>>''.  The processor is
     not stopped by entering local console mode.  The CPU may be
     halted with the ``halt'' command, which may be abbreviated
     to ``h.'' Conversational mode is re-entered by using the
     command ``c'' (continue).

     On 11/73 the processor's front panel halt switch must be
     pressed to put the console into ODT mode.	The ODT prompt is
     an ``@''.	No characters typed on the console are special
     while UNIX is in control of the console.
