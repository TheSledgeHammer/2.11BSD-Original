NAME
     lp - line printer

SYNOPSIS
     /sys/conf/SYSTEM:
	  NLP	     _l_p__p_r_i_n_t_e_r_s  # Line Printer
	  LP_MAXCOL  _1_3_2	  # Maximum number of columns on line printers

     /etc/dtab:
	  #Name Unit# Addr   Vector Br Handler(s)      # Comments
	  lp	?     177514 200    4  lpintr	       # lp-11 line printer

     major device number(s):
	  raw: 5
     minor device encoding:
	  bit 01 specifies 64-character set (instead of 96-character set)
	  bits 06 are reserved
	  bits 0370 specify line printer unit: <lp_unit> * 8

DESCRIPTION
     _L_p provides the interface to any of the standard DEC line
     printers on an LP-11 parallel interface.  When it is opened
     or closed, a suitable number of page ejects is generated.
     Bytes written are printed.

     The unit number of the printer is specified by the minor
     device after removing the low 3 bits, which act as per-
     device parameters.  Currently only the lowest of the low
     three bits is interpreted: if it is set, the device is
     treated as having a 64-character set, rather than a full
     96-character set.	In the resulting half-ASCII mode, lower
     case letters are turned into upper case and certain charac-
     ters are escaped according to the following table:

     {	       -(
     }	       -)
     `	       -'
     |	       -!
     ~	       -^

     The driver correctly interprets carriage returns, back-
     spaces, tabs, and form feeds.  Lines longer than the maximum
     page width are truncated.	The page width is specified via
     the LP_MAXCOL definition, set to 132 in the GENERIC distri-
     bution.

     never been tried.
