NAME
     sri - DR11-C IMP interface

SYNOPSIS
     /sys/conf/SYSTEM:
	  NSRI _s_r_i__c_o_n_t_r_o_l_l_e_r_s	   # SRI DR11c ARPAnet IMP

DESCRIPTION
DIAGNOSTICS
     sri%d: not alive.	The initialization routine was entered
     even though the device did not autoconfigure.  This indi-
     cates a system problem.

     sri%d: can't initialize.  Insufficient UNIBUS resources
     existed to initialize the device.	This is likely to occur
     when the device is run on a buffered data path on an 11/750
     and other network interfaces are also configured to use buf-
     fered data paths, or when it is configured to use buffered
     data paths on an 11/730 (which has none).

     sri%d: imp doesn't respond, ibf=%b.  The driver attempted to
     initialize the device, but the IMP failed to respond after 5
     tries.  Check the cabling.

     sri%d: stray xmit interrupt, csr=%b.  An interrupt occurred
     when no output had previously been started.

     sri%d: output error, csr=%b.  The device indicated a problem
     sending data on output.

     sri%d: input error, ibf=%b.  The device indicated a problem
     receiving data on input.

     sri%d: bad length=%d.  An input operation resulted in a data
     transfer of less than 10 or more than 1008 bytes of data
     into memory (according to the word count register).  This
     should never happen as the maximum size of a host-IMP mes-
     sage is 1018 bytes.
