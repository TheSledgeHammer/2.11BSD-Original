NAME
     imp - IMP raw socket interface

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/socket.h>
     #include <netinet/in.h>
     #include <netimp/if_imp.h>

     s = socket(AF_IMPLINK, SOCK_RAW, proto);

DESCRIPTION
     The raw imp socket provides direct access to the _i_m_p(4) net-
     work interface.  Users send packets through the interface
     using the _s_e_n_d(2) calls, and receive packets with the
     _r_e_c_v(2), calls.  All outgoing packets must have an 1822 96-
     bit leader on the front.  Likewise, packets received by the
     user will have this leader on the front.  The 1822 leader
     and the legal values for the various fields are defined in
     the include file <_n_e_t_i_m_p/_i_f__i_m_p._h>.  The raw imp interface
     automatically installs the length and destination address in
     the 1822 leader of all outgoing packets; these need not be
     filled in by the user.

     If the protocol selected, _p_r_o_t_o, is zero, the socket will
     receive all IMP messages except RFNM and incompletes which
     are not input data for a kernel protocol.	If _p_r_o_t_o is non-
     zero, only messages for the specified link type will be
     received.

DIAGNOSTICS
     An operation on a socket may fail with one of the following
     errors:

     [EISCONN]	    when trying to establish a connection on a
		    socket which already has one, or when trying
		    to send a datagram with the destination
		    address specified and the socket is already
		    connected;

     [ENOTCONN]     when trying to send a datagram, but no desti-
		    nation address is specified, and the socket
		    hasn't been connected;

     [ENOBUFS]	    when the system runs out of memory for an
		    internal data structure;

     [ENOBUFS]	    eight messages to the destination host are
		    outstanding, and another eight are already
		    queued for output;

     [EADDRNOTAVAIL]
		    when an attempt is made to create a socket
