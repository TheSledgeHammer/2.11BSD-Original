NAME
     telnetd - DARPA TELNET protocol server

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/libexec/telnetd

DESCRIPTION
     _T_e_l_n_e_t_d is a server which supports the DARPA standard TELNET
     virtual terminal protocol.  _T_e_l_n_e_t_d is invoked by the inter-
     net server (see _i_n_e_t_d(8)), normally for requests to connect
     to the TELNET port as indicated by the /_e_t_c/_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s file
     (see _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s(5)).

     _T_e_l_n_e_t_d operates by allocating a pseudo-terminal device (see
     _p_t_y(4)) for a client, then creating a login process which
     has the slave side of the pseudo-terminal as stdin, stdout,
     and stderr.  _T_e_l_n_e_t_d manipulates the master side of the
     pseudo-terminal, implementing the TELNET protocol and pass-
     ing characters between the remote client and the login pro-
     cess.

     When a TELNET session is started up, _t_e_l_n_e_t_d sends TELNET
     options to the client side indicating a willingness to do
     _r_e_m_o_t_e _e_c_h_o of characters, to _s_u_p_p_r_e_s_s _g_o _a_h_e_a_d, and to
     receive _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _t_y_p_e _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n from the remote client.
     If the remote client is willing, the remote terminal type is
     propagated in the environment of the created login process.
     The pseudo-terminal allocated to the client is configured to
     operate in "cooked" mode, and with XTABS and CRMOD enabled
     (see _t_t_y(4)).

     _T_e_l_n_e_t_d is willing to _d_o: _e_c_h_o, _b_i_n_a_r_y, _s_u_p_p_r_e_s_s _g_o _a_h_e_a_d,
     and _t_i_m_i_n_g _m_a_r_k.  _T_e_l_n_e_t_d is willing to have the remote
     client _d_o: _b_i_n_a_r_y, _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _t_y_p_e, and _s_u_p_p_r_e_s_s _g_o _a_h_e_a_d.

BUGS
     Some TELNET commands are only partially implemented.

     The TELNET protocol allows for the exchange of the number of
     lines and columns on the user's terminal, but _t_e_l_n_e_t_d
     doesn't make use of them.

     Because of bugs in the original 4.2 BSD _t_e_l_n_e_t(1C), _t_e_l_n_e_t_d
     performs some dubious protocol exchanges to try to discover
     if the remote client is, in fact, a 4.2 BSD _t_e_l_n_e_t(1C).

     _B_i_n_a_r_y _m_o_d_e has no common interpretation except between
     similar operating systems (Unix in this case).

TELNETD(8)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       TELNETD(8)



     The terminal type name received from the remote client is
     converted to lower case.

     The _p_a_c_k_e_t interface to the pseudo-terminal (see _p_t_y(4))
     should be used for more intelligent flushing of input and
     output queues.

     _T_e_l_n_e_t_d never sends TELNET _g_o _a_h_e_a_d commands.
