NAME
     slattach - attach serial lines as network interfaces

SYOPNSIS
     slattach ttyname [ _b_a_u_d_r_a_t_e ]

DESCRIPTION
     _S_l_a_t_t_a_c_h is used to assign a tty line to a network inter-
     face, and to define the network source and destination
     addresses. The _t_t_y_n_a_m_e parameter is a string of the form
     ``ttyXX'', or ``/dev/ttyXX''.  The optional _b_a_u_d_r_a_t_e parame-
     ter is used to set the speed of the connection. If not
     specified, the default of 9600 is used.

     Only the super-user may attach a network interface.

     To detach the interface, use `ifconfig _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e-_n_a_m_e down'
     after killing off the _s_l_a_t_t_a_c_h process.  _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e-_n_a_m_e is
     the name that is shown by netstat(1)

EXAMPLES
	     slattach ttyh8
	     slattach /dev/tty01 4800

DIAGNOSTICS
     Messages indicating the specified interface does not exit,
     the requested address is unknown, the user is not privileged
     and tried to alter an interface's configuration.
