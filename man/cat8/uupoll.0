NAME
     uupoll - poll a remote UUCP site

SYNOPSIS
     uupoll [ -g_g_r_a_d_e ] [ -n ] _s_y_s_t_e_m

DESCRIPTION
     _U_u_p_o_l_l is used to force a poll of a remote system. It queues
     a null job for the remote system and then invokes _u_u_c_i_c_o(8).

     The following options are available:

     -g_g_r_a_d_e Only send jobs of grade _g_r_a_d_e or higher on this
	     call.

     -n      Queue the null job, but do not invoke _u_u_c_i_c_o.

     _U_u_p_o_l_l is usually run by _c_r_o_n(5) or by a user who wants to
     hurry a job along. A typical entry in _c_r_o_n_t_a_b could be:

	  0    0,8,16	 *    *    *	/usr/bin/uupoll ihnp4
	  0    4,12,20	 *    *    *	/usr/bin/uupoll ucbvax
     This will poll ihnp4 at midnight, 0800, and 1600, and ucbvax
     at 0400, noon, and 2000.

     If the local machine is already running _u_u_c_i_c_o every hour
     and has a limited number of outgoing modems, a more elegant
     approach might be:

	  0    0,8,16	 *    *    *	/usr/bin/uupoll -n ihnp4
	  0    4,12,20	 *    *    *	/usr/bin/uupoll -n ucbvax
	  5    *	 *    *    *	/usr/sbin/uucico -r1
     This will queue null jobs for the remote sites at the top of
     hour; they will be processed by _u_u_c_i_c_o when it runs five
     minutes later.
