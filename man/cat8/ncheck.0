NAME
     ncheck  -	generate names from i-numbers

SYNOPSIS
     ncheck [ -i numbers ]  [ -a ] [ -s ]  [ filesystem ]

DESCRIPTION
     _N_c_h_e_c_k with no argument generates a pathname vs. i-number
     list of all files on a set of default file systems.  Names
     of directory files are followed by `/.'.  The -i option
     reduces the report to only those files whose i-numbers fol-
     low.  The -a option allows printing of the names `.' and
     `..', which are ordinarily suppressed.  The -s option
     reduces the report to special files and files with set-
     user-ID mode; it is intended to discover concealed viola-
     tions of security policy.

     A file system may be specified.

     The report is in no useful order, and probably should be
     sorted.

SEE ALSO
     sort(1), dcheck(8), fsck(8), icheck(8)

DIAGNOSTICS
     When the file system structure is improper, `??' denotes the
     `parent' of a parentless file and a pathname beginning with
     `...' denotes a loop.
