NAME
     dumpdir, 512dumpdir - print the names of files on a dump
     tape

SYNOPSIS
     _d_u_m_p_d_i_r [ f filename ]
     _5_1_2_d_u_m_p_d_i_r [ f filename ]

DESCRIPTION
     _D_u_m_p_d_i_r is used to read magtapes dumped with the _d_u_m_p com-
     mand and list the names and inode numbers of all the files
     and directories on the tape.

     The f option causes _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e as the name of the tape instead
     of the default.

     _5_1_2_d_u_m_p_d_i_r is a version of _d_u_m_p_d_i_r that can read tapes writ-
     ten from 512-byte block file systems.

FILES
     /dev/rmt1		 default file name
     rst*		 temporary files

SEE ALSO
     dump(8), restor(8)

DIAGNOSTICS
     If the dump extends over more than one tape, it may ask you
     to change tapes.  Reply with a newline when the next tape
     has been mounted.

BUGS
     There is redundant information on the tape that could be
     used in case of tape reading problems.  Unfortunately, _d_u_m_p_-
     _d_i_r and _5_1_2_d_u_m_p_d_i_r don't use it.
