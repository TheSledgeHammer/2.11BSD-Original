NAME
     bugfiler - file bug reports in folders automatically

SYNOPSIS
     bugfiler [ mail directory ]

DESCRIPTION
     _B_u_g_f_i_l_e_r is a program to automatically intercept bug
     reports, summarize them and store them in the appropriate
     sub directories of the mail directory specified on the com-
     mand line or the (system dependent) default.  It is designed
     to be compatible with the Rand MH mail system.  _B_u_g_f_i_l_e_r is
     normally invoked by the mail delivery program through
     _a_l_i_a_s_e_s(5) with a line such as the following in
     /etc/aliases.

	  bugs:"|bugfiler /usr/bugs/mail"

     It reads the message from the standard input or the named
     file, checks the format and returns mail acknowledging
     receipt or a message indicating the proper format.  Valid
     reports are then summarized and filed in the appropriate
     folder; improperly formatted messages are filed in a folder
     named ``errors.'' Program maintainers can then log onto the
     system and check the summary file for bugs that pertain to
     them.  Bug reports should be submitted in RFC822 format and
     aremust contain the following header lines to be properly
     indexed:

	  Date: <date the report is received>
	  From: <valid return address>
	  Subject: <short summary of the problem>
	  Index: <source directory>/<source file> <version> [Fix]

     In addition, the body of the message must contain a line
     which begins with ``Description:'' followed by zero or more
     lines describing the problem in detail and a line beginning
     with ``Repeat-By:'' followed by zero or more lines describ-
     ing how to repeat the problem.  If the keyword `Fix' is
     specified in the `Index' line, then there must also be a
     line beginning with ``Fix:'' followed by a diff of the old
     and new source files or a description of what was done to
     fix the problem.

     The `Index' line is the key to the filing mechanism. The
     source directory name must match one of the folder names in
     the mail directory.  The message is then filed in this
     folder and a line appended to the summary file in the fol-
     lowing format:

	  <folder name>/<message number>     <Index info>
				   <Subject info>

     The bug report may also be redistributed according to the
     index.  If the file _m_a_i_l_d_i_r/.redist exists, it is examined
     for a line beginning with the index name followed with a
     tab.  The remainder of this line contains a comma-separated
     list of mail addresses which should receive copies of bugs
     with this index.  The list may be continued onto multiple
     lines by ending each but the last with a backslash (`\').

FILES
     /usr/sbin/sendmail       mail delivery program
     /usr/libexec/unixtomh    converts unix mail format to mh
     format
     maildir/.ack	      the message sent in acknowledgement
     maildir/.format	      the message sent when format errors
     are detected
     maildir/.redist	      the redistribution list
     maildir/summary	      the summary file
     maildir/Bf??????	      temporary copy of the input message
     maildir/Rp??????	      temporary file for the reply mes-
     sage.

BUGS
     Since mail can be forwarded in a number of different ways,
     _b_u_g_f_i_l_e_r does not recognize forwarded mail and will
     reply/complain to the forwarder instead of the original
     sender unless there is a `Reply-To' field in the header.

     Duplicate messages should be discarded or recognized and put
     somewhere else.
