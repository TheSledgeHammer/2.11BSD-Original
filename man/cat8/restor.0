NAME
     restor - incremental file system restore

SYNOPSIS
     _r_e_s_t_o_r key [ argument ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _R_e_s_t_o_r is used to read magtapes dumped with the _d_u_m_p com-
     mand.  The _k_e_y specifies what is to be done.  _K_e_y is one of
     the characters rRxt optionally combined with f.

     f	  Use the first _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t as the name of the tape instead
	  of the default.

     r or R
	  The tape is read and loaded into the file system speci-
	  fied in _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t. This should not be done lightly (see
	  below).  If the key is R _r_e_s_t_o_r asks which tape of a
	  multi volume set to start on.  This allows restor to be
	  interrupted and then restarted (an _i_c_h_e_c_k -s must be
	  done before restarting ).

     x	  Each file on the tape named by an _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t is
	  extracted.  The file name has all `mount' prefixes
	  removed; for example, /usr/bin/lpr is named /bin/lpr on
	  the tape.  The file extracted is placed in a file with
	  a numeric name supplied by _r_e_s_t_o_r (actually the inode
	  number).  In order to keep the amount of tape read to a
	  minimum, the following procedure is recommended:

	  Mount volume 1 of the set of dump tapes.

	  Type the _r_e_s_t_o_r command.

	  _R_e_s_t_o_r will announce whether or not it found the files,
	  give the number it will name the file, and rewind the
	  tape.

	  It then asks you to `mount the desired tape volume'.
	  Type the number of the volume you choose.  On a mul-
	  tivolume dump the recommended procedure is to mount the
	  last through the first volume in that order.	_R_e_s_t_o_r
	  checks to see if any of the files requested are on the
	  mounted tape (or a later tape, thus the reverse order)
	  and doesn't read through the tape if no files are.  If
	  you are working with a single volume dump or the number
	  of files being restored is large, respond to the query
	  with `1' and _r_e_s_t_o_r will read the tapes in sequential
	  order.

	  If you have a hierarchy to restore you can use _d_u_m_p_-
	  _d_i_r(8) to produce the list of names and a shell script

	  to move the resulting files to their homes.

     t	  Print the date the tape was written and the date the
	  file system was dumped from.

     The r option should only be used to restore a complete dump
     tape onto a clear file system or to restore an incremental
     dump tape onto this.  Thus

	  mkfs /dev/hp0a 4807
	  restor r /dev/hp0a

     is a typical sequence to restore a complete dump.	Another
     _r_e_s_t_o_r can be done to get an incremental dump in on top of
     this.

     A _d_u_m_p followed by a _m_k_f_s and a _r_e_s_t_o_r is used to change the
     size of a file system.

FILES
     /dev/rmt1		 default file name
     rst*		 temporary files

SEE ALSO
     dump(8), dumpdir(8), mkfs(8)

DIAGNOSTICS
     There are various diagnostics involved with reading the tape
     and writing the disk.  There are also diagnostics if the i-
     list or the free list of the file system is not large enough
     to hold the dump.

     If the dump extends over more than one tape, it may ask you
     to change tapes.  Reply with a newline when the next tape
     has been mounted.

     Dump tapes made before the new ondisc directory structure
     will be converted automatically by _r_e_s_t_o_r .

BUGS
     There is redundant information on the tape that could be
     used in case of tape reading problems.  Unfortunately, _r_e_s_-
     _t_o_r does't use it.
