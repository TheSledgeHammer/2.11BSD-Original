NAME
     identd, in.identd - TCP/IP IDENT protocol server

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/libexec/[in.]identd [-i|-w|-b [-t<seconds>] [-u<uid>]
     [-g<gid>] [-p<port>] [-a<address>] [-c<charset>]
     [-C[<keyfile>]] [-o] [-e] [-l] [-V] [-m] [-N] [-d]
     [-F<format>] [kernelfile[kmemfile]]

DESCRIPTION
     identd is a server which implements the TCP/IP proposed
     standard IDENT user identification protocol as specified in
     the RFC 1413 document.

     identd operates by looking up specific TCP/IP connections
     and returning the user name of the process owning the con-
     nection.  It can optionally return other information instead
     of a user name.

ARGUMENTS
     The -i flag, which is the default mode, should be used when
     starting the daemon from inetd with the "nowait" option in
     the /etc/inetd.conf file. Use of this mode will make inetd
     start one identd daemon for each connection request.

     The -w flag should be used when starting the daemon from
     inetd with the "wait" option in the /etc/inetd.conf file .
     This is the prefered mode of operation since that will start
     a copy of identd at the first connection request and then
     identd will handle subsequent requests without having to do
     the nlist lookup in the kernel file for every request as in
     the -i mode above. The identd daemon will run either for-
     ever, until a bug makes it crash or a timeout, as specified
     by the -t flag, occurs.

     The -b flag can be used to make the daemon run in standalone
     mode without the assistance from inetd.  This mode is the
     least prefered mode since a bug or any other fatal condition
     in the server will make it terminate and it will then have
     to be restarted manually. Other than that it has the same
     advantage as the -w mode in that it parses the nlist only
     once.

     The -t<seconds> option is used to specify the timeout limit.
     This is the number of seconds a server started with the -w
     flag will wait for new connections before terminating. The
     server is automatically restarted by inetd whenever a new
     connection is requested if it has terminated. A suitable
     value for this is 120 (2 minutes), if used. It defaults to
     no timeout (i.e. will wait forever, or until a fatal condi-
     tion occurs in the server).

     The -u<uid> option is used to specify a user id number which
     the ident server should switch to after binding itself to
     the TCP/IP port if using the -b mode of operation.

     The -g<gid> option is used to specify a group id number
     which the ident server should switch to after binding itself
     to the TCP/IP port if using the -b mode of operation.

     The -p<port> option is used to specify an alternative port
     number to bind to if using the -b mode of operation. It can
     be specified by name or by number. Defaults to the IDENT
     port (113).

     The -a<address> option is used to specify the local address
     to bind the socket to if using the -b mode of operation. Can
     only be specified by IP address and not by domain name.
     Defaults to the INADDR_ANY address which normally means all
     local addresses.

     The -V flag makes identd display the version number and then
     exit.

     The -l flag tells identd to use the System logging daemon
     syslogd for logging purposes.

     The -o flag tells identd to not reveal the operating system
     type it is run on and to instead always return "OTHER".

     The -e flag tells identd to always return "UNKNOWN-ERROR"
     instead of the "NO-USER" or "INVALID-PORT" errors.

     The -c<charset> flags tells identd to add the optional
     (according to the IDENT protocol) character set designator
     to the reply generated. _c_h_a_r_s_e_t should be a valid character
     set as described in the MIME RFC in upper case characters.

     The -C[<keyfile>] option tells identd to return encrypted
     tokens instead of user names.  The local and remote IP
     addresses and TCP port numbers, the local user's uid number,
     a timestamp, a random number, and a checksum, are all
     encrypted using DES with a secret key derived from the first
     line of the _k_e_y_f_i_l_e (using des_string_to_key(3)).	The
     encrypted binary information is then encoded in a base64
     string (32 characters in length) and enclosed in square
     brackets to produce a token that is transmitted to the
     remote client.  The encrypted token can later be decrypted
     by idecrypt(8).  There may not be a space between the -C and
     the name of the _k_e_y_f_i_l_e.  If the _k_e_y_f_i_l_e is not specified,
     it defaults to /etc/identd.key.

     The -n flag tells identd to always return user numbers
     instead of user names if you wish to keep the user names a

     secret.  The -N flag makes identd check for a file
     ".noident" in each homedirectory for a user which the daemon
     is about to return the user name for. It that file exists
     then the daemon will give the error HIDDEN-USER instead of
     the normal USERID response.

     -m flag makes identd use a mode of operation that will allow
     multiple requests to be processed per session. Each request
     is specified one per line and the responses will be returned
     one per line. The connection will not be closed until the
     connecting part closes it's end of the line.  PLEASE NOTE
     THAT THIS MODE VIOLATES THE PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION AS IT
     CURRENTLY STANDS.

     The -d flag enables some debugging code that normally should
     NOT be enabled since that breaks the protocol and may reveal
     information that should not be available to outsiders.

     The -F<format> option makes identd use the specified format
     to display info. The allowed format specifiers are:
	  %u   print user name
	  %U   print user number
	  %g   print (primary) group name
	  %G   print (primary) group number
	  %l   print list of all groups by name
	  %L   print list of all groups by number
	  %p   print process ID of running process
	  %c   print command name
	  %C   print command and arguments
     The lists of groups (%l, %L) are comma-separated, and start
     with the primary group which is not repeated. The %p and the
     %c and %C formats are not supported on all architecture
     implementations (printing 0 or empty string instead).
     Any other characters (preceded by %, and those not preceded
     by it) are printed literally. The "default" format is %u,
     and you should not use anything else without the -o flag.
     Not implemented yet, but on my wish-list are the following:
	  %w   print working (current) directory
	  %h   print home (login, naming) directory
	  %e   print the environment

     kernelfile defaults to the normally running kernel file.

     kmemfile defaults to the memory space of the normally run-
     ning kernel.

UNDOCUMENTED FLAGS
     The -v flag enables more verbose output or messages.
     (Further occurences of the -v flag make things even more
     verbose.) Currently not used: ignored.

     The -f<config-file> option causes identd to use the named
     config file (instead of the default /etc/identd.conf ?).
     Currently not used: ignored, no config files are used.

     The -r<indirect_host> option is used in some way (for proxy
     queries?).

     The -C<keyfile> option is used in some way for DES encryp-
     tion.

INSTALLATION
     identd is invoked either by the internet server (see
     inetd(8C) ) for requests to connect to the IDENT port as
     indicated by the /etc/services file (see services(5) ) when
     using the -w or -i modes of operation or started manually by
     using the -b mode of operation.

EXAMPLES
     Assuming the server is located in /usr/etc/in.identd one can
     put either:

     ident stream tcp wait sys /usr/etc/in.identd in.identd -w
     -t120

     or:

     ident stream tcp nowait sys /usr/etc/in.identd in.identd -i

     into the /etc/inetd.conf file. User "sys" should have enough
     rights to READ the kernel but NOT to write to it.

     To start it using the -b mode of operation one can put a
     line like this into the /etc/rc.local file:

     /usr/etc/in.identd -b -u2 -g2

     This will make it run in the background as user 2, group 2
     (user "sys", group "kmem" on SunOS 4.1.1).

NOTES
     The username (or UID) returned ought to be the login name.
     However it (probably, for most architecture implementations)
     is the "real user ID" as stored with the process; there is
     no provision for returning the "effective user ID". Thus the
     UID returned may be different from the login name for setuid
     programs (or those running as root) which done a setuid(3)
     call and their children. For example, it may (should?) be
     wrong for an incoming ftpd ; and we are probably interested
     in the running shell, not the telnetd for an incoming telnet
     session. (But of course identd returns info for outgoing
     connections, not incoming ones.)

     The group or list of groups returned (with the -F option)
     are as looked up in the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files,
     based on the UID returned. Thus these may not relate well to
     the group(s) of the running process for setuid or setgid
     programs or their children.

     The command names returned with formats %c and %C may be
     different, use one or the other or both.

FILES
     /etc/identd.conf
	  This file is as yet un-used, but will eventually con-
	  tain configuration options for identd

     /etc/identd.key
	  If compiled with -_l_d_e_s this file can be used to specify
	  a secret key for encrypting replies.

BUGS
     The handling of fatal errors could be better.
