NAME
     fstat - file status

SYNOPSIS
     fstat [ -u user ] [ -p pid ] [ filename... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _F_s_t_a_t identifies open files.  A file is considered open if a
     process has it open, if it is the working directory for a
     process, or if it is an active pure text file.  If no
     options are specified, _f_s_t_a_t reports on all open files.

     Options:

     -u    Report all files open by a specified user.

     -p    Report all files open by a specified process id.

     filename...
	   Restrict reports to the specified files.  If the file
	   is a block special file, _f_s_t_a_t additionally reports on
	   any open files on that device, treating it as a
	   mounted file system.

     The following fields are printed

     USER  The username of the owner of the process.

     CMD   The command name of the process.

     PID   The process id.

     FD    The file number in the per-process open file table.
	   The special names "text" and "wd" mean that the file
	   is the pure text inode or the working directory for
	   the process.  If the file number is followed by an
	   asterick (*), then the file is not an inode, but
	   either a socket, fifo, or has an error of some kind.
	   In this case the rest of the entry is variable format,
	   doesn't correspond to the rest of the headings, and is
	   enclosed in parenthesis.  The following paragraph
	   describing sockets will explain the variable format.

     DEVICE
	   Major minor number of the device this file exists on.

     INODE The inode number of the file.

     SIZE  The size in bytes of the file.

     TYPE  The type of the file. (see sys/file.h)

     Sockets

     The formating of open sockets depends on the protocol
     domain.  In all cases the first field is the domain name,
     the second field is the socket type (stream, dgram, etc),
     and the third is the socket flags field (in hex).	The
     remaining fields are protocol dependent.  For tcp, it is the
     address of the tcpcb, and for udp, the inpcb (socket pcb).
     For unix domain sockets, its the address of the socket pcb
     and the address of the connected pcb (if connected).  Other-
     wise the protocol number and address of the socket itself
     are printed. The idea is not to duplicate netstat, but to
     make available enough information for further analysis.  For
     example, the addresses mentioned above are the addresses
     which the "netstat -A" command would print for tcp, udp, and
     unixdomain.  Note that since pipe(2) is implemented with
     sockets, a pipe appears as a connected unix domain stream
     socket.  A unidirectional unix domain socket indicates the
     direction of flow with an arrow ("<-" or "->"), and a full
     duplex socket shows a double arrow ("<->").

BUGS
     Socket information clutters the output.

     Since _f_s_t_a_t takes a snapshot of the system, it is only
     correct for a very short period of time.
