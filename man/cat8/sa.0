NAME
     sa - system accounting

SYNOPSIS
     sa [ -abcdDfijkKlnrstu ] [ -v _t_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d ] [ -S savacctfile ]
     [ -U usracctfile ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
     _S_a reports on, cleans up, and generally maintains accounting
     files.

     _S_a is able to condense the information in /_u_s_r/_a_d_m/_a_c_c_t into
     a summary file /_u_s_r/_a_d_m/_s_a_v_a_c_c_t which contains a count of
     the number of times each command was called and the time
     resources consumed.  This condensation is desirable because
     on a large system /_u_s_r/_a_d_m/_a_c_c_t can grow by 100 blocks per
     day.  The summary file is normally read before the account-
     ing file, so the reports include all available information.

     If a file name is given as the last argument, that file will
     be treated as the accounting file; /_u_s_r/_a_d_m/_a_c_c_t is the
     default.

     Output fields are labeled: "cpu" for the sum of user+system
     time (in minutes), "re" for real time (also in minutes), "k"
     for cpu-time averaged core usage (in 1k units), "avio" for
     average number of i/o operations per execution.  With
     options fields labeled "tio" for total i/o operations,
     "k*sec" for cpu storage integral (kilo-core seconds), "u"
     and "s" for user and system cpu time alone (both in minutes)
     will sometimes appear.

     There are near a googol of options:

     a	  Print all command names, even those containing unprint-
	  able characters and those used only once.  By default,
	  those are placed under the name `***other.'

     b	  Sort output by sum of user and system time divided by
	  number of calls.  Default sort is by sum of user and
	  system times.

     c	  Besides total user, system, and real time for each com-
	  mand print percentage of total time over all commands.

     d	  Sort by average number of disk i/o operations.

     D	  Print and sort by total number of disk i/o operations.

     f	  Force no interactive threshold compression with -v
	  flag.

     i	  Don't read in summary file.

     j	  Instead of total minutes time for each category, give
	  seconds per call.

     k	  Sort by cpu-time average memory usage.

     K	  Print and sort by cpu-storage integral.

     l	  Separate system and user time; normally they are com-
	  bined.

     m	  Print number of processes and number of CPU minutes for
	  each user.

     n	  Sort by number of calls.

     r	  Reverse order of sort.

     s	  Merge accounting file into summary file
	  /_u_s_r/_a_d_m/_s_a_v_a_c_c_t when done.

     t	  For each command report ratio of real time to the sum
	  of user and system times.

     u	  Superseding all other flags, print for each command in
	  the accounting file the user ID and command name.

     v	  Followed by a number _n, types the name of each command
	  used _n times or fewer.  Await a reply from the termi-
	  nal; if it begins with `y', add the command to the
	  category `**junk**.' This is used to strip out garbage.

     S	  The following filename is used as the command summary
	  file instead of /_u_s_r/_a_d_m/_s_a_v_a_c_c_t.

     U	  The following filename is used instead of
	  /_u_s_r/_a_d_m/_u_s_r_a_c_c_t to accumulate the per-user statistics
	  printed by the -m option.

FILES
     /usr/adm/acct	 raw accounting
     /usr/adm/savacct	 summary
     /usr/adm/usracct	 per-user summary

SEE ALSO

BUGS
     The number of options to this program is absurd.
