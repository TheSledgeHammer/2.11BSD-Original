NAME
     swapon - specify additional device for paging and swapping

SYNOPSIS
     swapon -a
     swapon name ...

DESCRIPTION
     _S_w_a_p_o_n is used to specify additional devices on which paging
     and swapping are to take place.  The system begins by swap-
     ping and paging on only a single device so that only one
     disk is required at bootstrap time.  Calls to _s_w_a_p_o_n nor-
     mally occur in the system multi-user initialization file
     /_e_t_c/_r_c making all swap devices available, so that the pag-
     ing and swapping activity is interleaved across several dev-
     ices.

     Normally, the -a argument is given, causing all devices
     marked as ``sw'' swap devices in /etc/fstab to be made
     available.

     The second form gives individual block devices as given in
     the system swap configuration table.  The call makes only
     this space available to the system for swap allocation.

SEE ALSO
     swapon(2), init(8)

FILES
     /dev/[ru][pk]?b	 normal paging devices

BUGS
     There is no way to stop paging and swapping on a device.  It
     is therefore not possible to make use of devices which may
     be dismounted during system operation.

     swapon is not implemented in 2.11BSD.
