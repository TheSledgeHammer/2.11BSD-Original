NAME
     uuxqt - UUCP execution file interpreter

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/libexec/uuxqt [ -x_d_e_b_u_g ]

DESCRIPTION
     _U_u_x_q_t interprets _e_x_e_c_u_t_i_o_n _f_i_l_e_s created on a remote system
     via _u_u_x(1) and transferred to the local system via
     _u_u_c_i_c_o(8).  When a user uses _u_u_x to request remote command
     execution, it is _u_u_x_q_t that actually executes the command.
     Normally, _u_u_x_q_t is forked from _u_u_c_i_c_o to process queued exe-
     cution files; for debugging, it may also be run manually by
     the UUCP administrator.

     _U_u_x_q_t runs in its own subdirectory, /_u_s_r/_s_p_o_o_l/_u_u_c_p/_X_T_M_P.
     It copies intermediate files to this directory when neces-
     sary.
