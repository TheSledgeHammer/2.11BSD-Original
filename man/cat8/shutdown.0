NAME
     shutdown - close down the system at a given time

SYNOPSIS
     shutdown [ -k ] [ -r ] [ -h ] [ -f ] [ -n ] time [ warning-
     message ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _S_h_u_t_d_o_w_n provides an automated shutdown procedure which a
     super-user can use to notify users nicely when the system is
     shutting down, saving them from system administrators, hack-
     ers, and gurus, who would otherwise not bother with
     niceties.

     _T_i_m_e is the time at which _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n will bring the system
     down and may be the word now (indicating an immediate shut-
     down) or specify a future time in one of two formats:
     +number and hour:min.  The first form brings the system down
     in _n_u_m_b_e_r minutes and the second brings the system down at
     the time of day indicated (as a 24-hour clock).

     At intervals which get closer together as apocalypse
     approaches, warning messages are displayed at the terminals
     of all users on the system.  Five minutes before shutdown,
     or immediately if shutdown is in less than 5 minutes, logins
     are disabled by creating /etc/nologin and writing a message
     there.  If this file exists when a user attempts to log in,
     _l_o_g_i_n(1) prints its contents and exits.  The file is removed
     just before _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n exits.

     At shutdown time a message is written in the system log,
     containing the time of shutdown, who ran shutdown and the
     reason.  Then a terminate signal is sent to _i_n_i_t to bring
     the system down to single-user state.  Alternatively, if -r,
     -h, or -k was used, then _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n will exec _r_e_b_o_o_t(8),
     _h_a_l_t(8), or avoid shutting the system down (respectively).
     (If it isn't obvious, -k is to make people _t_h_i_n_k the system
     is going down!)

     With the -f option, _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n arranges, in the manner of
     _f_a_s_t_b_o_o_t(8), that when the system is rebooted the file sys-
     tems will not be checked.	The -n option prevents the normal
     _s_y_n_c(2) before stopping.

     The time of the shutdown and the warning message are placed
     in /etc/nologin and should be used to inform the users about
     when the system will be back up and why it is going down (or
     anything else).

FILES
     /etc/nologin   tells login not to let anyone log in

     Only allows you to kill the system between now and 23:59 if
     you use the absolute time for shutdown.
