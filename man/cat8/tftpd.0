NAME
     tftpd - DARPA Trivial File Transfer Protocol server

SYNOPSIS
     tftpd [ directory ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _T_f_t_p_d is a server which supports the DARPA Trivial File
     Transfer Protocol.  The TFTP server operates at the port
     indicated in the ``tftp'' service description; see _s_e_r_-
     _v_i_c_e_s(5).	The server is normally started by _i_n_e_t_d(8).

     The use of _t_f_t_p does not require an account or password on
     the remote system.  Due to the lack of authentication infor-
     mation, _t_f_t_p_d will allow only publicly readable files to be
     accessed.	Files may be written only if they already exist
     and are publicly writable.  Note that this extends the con-
     cept of ``public'' to include all users on all hosts that
     can be reached through the network; this may not be
     appropriate on all systems, and its implications should be
     considered before enabling tftp service.  The server should
     have the user ID with the lowest possible privilege.

     Access to files may be restricted by invoking _t_f_t_p_d with a
     list of directories by including pathnames as server program
     arguments in /_e_t_c/_i_n_e_t_d._c_o_n_f.  In this case access is res-
     tricted to files whose names are prefixed by the one of the
     given directories.
