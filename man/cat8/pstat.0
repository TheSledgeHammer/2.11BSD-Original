NAME
     pstat - print system facts

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/sbin/pstat -aixptufT [ suboptions ] [ system ] [ core-
     file ]

DESCRIPTION
     _P_s_t_a_t interprets the contents of certain system tables.  If
     _c_o_r_e_f_i_l_e is given, the tables are sought there, otherwise in
     /_d_e_v/_k_m_e_m. The required namelist is taken from /_v_m_u_n_i_x
     unless _s_y_s_t_e_m is specified.  Options are

     -a    Under -p, describe all process slots rather than just
	   active ones.

     NLK   Number of links to this inode.
     UID   User ID of owner.
     SIZ/DEV
	   Number of bytes in an ordinary file, or major and
	   minor device of special file.

     -x    Print the text table with these headings:

     LOC   The core location of this table entry.
     FLAGS Miscellaneous state variables encoded thus:
	   T	_p_t_r_a_c_e(2) in effect
	   W	text not yet written on swap device

	   1000     detached inherited by init
	   2000     no SIGCHLD signal to parent

     SIG   Signals received (signals 1-32 coded in bits 0-31),
     UID   Real user ID.
     SLP   Amount of time process has been blocked.

	   argument is its address as given by _p_s(1).  The pro-
	   cess must be in main memory, or the file used can be a
	   core image and the address 0.  Only the fields located
	   in the first page cluster can be located succesfully
	   if the process is in main memory.

     -f    Print the open file table with these headings:

     LOC   The core location of this table entry.

     TYPE  The type of object the file table entry points to.
     FLG   Miscellaneous state variables encoded thus:
	   R	open for reading
	   W	open for writing
	   A	open for appending
	   S	shared lock present
	   X	exclusive lock present
	   I	signal pgrp when data ready
     CNT   Number of processes that know this open file.
     MSG   Number of messages outstanding for this file.
     DATA  The location of the inode table entry or socket struc-
	   ture for this file.
     OFFSET
	   The file offset (see _l_s_e_e_k(2)).

     -s print information about swap space usage: the number of
     (1k byte) pages used and free is given as well as the number
     of used pages which belong to text images.

     -T prints the number of used and free slots in the several
     system tables and is useful for checking to see how full
     system tables have become if the system is under heavy load.

FILES
     /vmunix	namelist
     /dev/kmem	default source of tables

BUGS
     It would be very useful if the system recorded "maximum
     occupancy" on the tables reported by -T; even more useful if
     these tables were dynamically allocated.
