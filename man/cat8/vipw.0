NAME
     vipw - edit the password file

SYNOPSIS
     vipw

DESCRIPTION
     _V_i_p_w edits the password file while setting the appropriate
     locks, and does any necessary processing after the password
     file is unlocked.	If the password file is already being
     edited, then you will be told to try again later.	The _v_i
     editor will be used unless the environment variable EDITOR
     indicates an alternate editor.

     _V_i_p_w performs a number of consistency checks on the password
     entries, and will not allow a password file with a ``man-
     gled'' entry to be installed.  If _v_i_p_w rejects the new pass-
     word file, the user is prompted to re-enter the edit ses-
     sion.

     Once the information has been verified, _v_i_p_w uses
     _m_k_p_a_s_s_w_d(8) to update the user database.  This is run in the
     background, and, at very large sites could take several
     minutes.  Until this update is completed, the password file
     is unavailable for other updates and the new information
     will not be available to programs.
