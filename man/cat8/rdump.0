NAME
     rdump - file system dump across the network

SYNOPSIS
     rdump [ key [ _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t ... ] filesystem ]

DESCRIPTION
     _R_d_u_m_p copies to magnetic tape all files changed after a cer-
     tain date in the _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m. The command is identical in
     operation to _d_u_m_p(8) except the _f key should be specified
     and the file supplied should be of the form _m_a_c_h_i_n_e:_d_e_v_i_c_e.

     _R_d_u_m_p creates a remote server, /_u_s_r/_s_b_i_n/_r_m_t, on the client
     machine to access the tape device.

SEE ALSO
     dump(8), rmt(8)

DIAGNOSTICS
     Same as _d_u_m_p(8) with a few extra related to the network.
