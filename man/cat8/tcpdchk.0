NAME
     tcpdchk - tcp wrapper configuration checker

SYNOPSYS
     tcpdchk [-a] [-d] [-i inet_conf] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     _t_c_p_d_c_h_k examines your tcp wrapper configuration and reports
     all potential and real problems it can find. The program
     examines the _t_c_p_d access control files (by default, these
     are /_e_t_c/_h_o_s_t_s._a_l_l_o_w and /_e_t_c/_h_o_s_t_s._d_e_n_y), and compares the
     entries in these files against entries in the _i_n_e_t_d or _t_l_i_d
     network configuration files.

     _t_c_p_d_c_h_k reports problems such as non-existent pathnames;
     services that appear in _t_c_p_d access control rules, but are
     not controlled by _t_c_p_d; services that should not be wrapped;
     non-existent host names or non-internet address forms;
     occurrences of host aliases instead of official host names;
     hosts with a name/address conflict; inappropriate use of
     wildcard patterns; inappropriate use of NIS netgroups or
     references to non-existent NIS netgroups; references to
     non-existent options; invalid arguments to options; and so
     on.

     Where possible, _t_c_p_d_c_h_k provides a helpful suggestion to fix
     the problem.

OPTIONS
     -a   Report access control rules that permit access without
	  an explicit ALLOW keyword. This applies only when the
	  extended access control language is enabled (build with
	  -DPROCESS_OPTIONS).

     -d   Examine _h_o_s_t_s._a_l_l_o_w and _h_o_s_t_s._d_e_n_y files in the current
	  directory instead of the default ones.

     -i inet_conf
	  Specify this option when _t_c_p_d_c_h_k is unable to find your
	  _i_n_e_t_d._c_o_n_f or _t_l_i_d._c_o_n_f network configuration file, or
	  when you suspect that the program uses the wrong one.

     -v   Display the contents of each access control rule.  Dae-
	  mon lists, client lists, shell commands and options are
	  shown in a pretty-printed format; this makes it easier
	  for you to spot any discrepancies between what you want
	  and what the program understands.

FILES
     The default locations of the _t_c_p_d access control tables are:
