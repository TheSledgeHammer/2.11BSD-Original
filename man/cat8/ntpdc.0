NAME
     ntpdc - monitor operation of ntp daemon

SYNOPSIS
     ntpdc [-n] [-v] _h_o_s_t_s...

DESCRIPTION
     _n_t_p_d_c sends an INFO_QUERY packet to an ntp daemon running on
     the given hosts.  Each daemon responds with information
     about each of its peers, which _n_t_p_d_c formats on the standard
     output.

     Normally, the name of the responding host and its peers are
     printed.  The -n switch disables this, printing only inter-
     net addresses.

     Default is a terse, table-style report.  The -t switch gen-
     erates an alternate form of the terse report.  The -v switch
     generates a verbose report.


TERSE REPORT
     A typical terse report looks like:

	(rem)  Address	 (lcl)	    Strat Poll Reach	Delay	Offset	  Disp
     ==========================================================================
     -umd1	     128.8.10.14       1   64  266	 3.0	-65.0	   0.0
     *DCN1.ARPA      128.8.10.14       1  256  332     155.0	 -4.0	   0.0
      128.8.251.92   128.8.10.14       2   64  367     -16.0	-61.0	   0.0
      idunno.Princeto 128.8.10.14	3   64	252	 60.0	 -53.0	    0.0
      leo	128.8.10.14	  2   64  275	    4.0   -273.0   1536.2


     The alternate form is only slightly different; it looks
     like:

	 Address      Reference     Strat Poll Reach	Delay	Offset	  Disp
     ==========================================================================
     -umd1	     WWVB	       1   64  266	 3.0	-65.0	   0.0
     *DCN1.ARPA      WWVB	       1  256  332     155.0	 -4.0	   0.0
      128.8.251.92   umd1	       2   64  367     -16.0	-61.0	   0.0
      idunno.Prince trantor	      3   64  252      60.0    -53.0	  0.0
      leo	umd1		  2   64  275	    4.0   -273.0   1536.2


     Fields are interpreted as follows:

     - or *:
	  The - mark indicates a pre-configured peer (mentioned
	  in ntp.conf).  the * mark shows which pre-configured
	  peer (if any) is currently being used for synchroniza-
	  tion.

     (rem) address:
	  The remote host name or internet address of a peer.

     (lcl) address:
	  The "local" host as specified as an argument to _n_t_p_d_c.

     Reference:
	  The reference time source being used for synchroniza-
	  tion by the peer.

     Strat:
	  The stratum level of the peer (as perceived by the
	  local host).

     Poll:
	  Current polling interval in seconds for this peer.

     Reach:
	  Octal value of a shift register indicating which
	  responses were received from the previous 8 polls to
	  this peer (see RFC-????).

     Delay:
	  Round-trip delay in milliseconds for this peer as of
	  the latest poll.

     Disp:
	  Current value of dispersion (see RFC-????) in mil-
	  liseconds for this peer.


VERBOSE REPORTS
     When the -v flag is given a series of verbose reports are
     presented.  A typical one looks like this:

     Neighbor address 128.4.0.6 port:123  local address 192.35.201.47
     Reach: 0376 stratum: 1 poll int(HPI): 10 precision: -10

     Poll int(MPI): 10 threshold: 1024 timer: 1024 send: 266 received: 192 samples: 9
     Delay(ms)	1144.00 1296.00 1118.00 1115.00 1225.00 1129.00 1086.00 1087.00
     Offset(ms)   19.00   92.00  -17.00   12.00   41.00    4.00   -1.00  -14.00

	  delay: 1086.000000 offset: -1.000000 dsp 0.014000


     Fields are interpreted as follows:

     Neighbor address...:
	  The address and port number of this neighbor, followed
	  by the local address.

     precision: _n_n
	  The precision of this clock, given in seconds as a
	  power of 2.  _e._g A clock derived from the power line
	  frequency (60 Hz) has a precision of 1/60 second (about
	  2^-6) and would be indicated by a precision of -6.

	  Synchronizing distance.  Always zero in the current
	  implementation.

	  Dispersion.

     flags: _n_n
