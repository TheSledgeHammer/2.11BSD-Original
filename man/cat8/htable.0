NAME
     htable - convert NIC standard format host tables

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/htable [ -c _c_o_n_n_e_c_t_e_d-_n_e_t_s ] [ -l _l_o_c_a_l-_n_e_t_s ] _f_i_l_e

DESCRIPTION
     _H_t_a_b_l_e is used to convert host files in the format specified
     in Internet RFC 810 to the format used by the network
     library routines.	Three files are created as a result of
     running _h_t_a_b_l_e: _h_o_s_t_s, _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, and _g_a_t_e_w_a_y_s.  The _h_o_s_t_s
     file may be used by the _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_n_a_m_e(3N) routines in map-
     ping host names to addresses if the nameserver, _n_a_m_e_d(8), is
     not used.	The _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s file is used by the _g_e_t_n_e_t_e_n_t(3N)
     routines in mapping network names to numbers.  The _g_a_t_e_w_a_y_s
     file may be used by the routing daemon in identifying ``pas-
     sive'' Internet gateways; see _r_o_u_t_e_d(8C) for an explanation.

     If any of the files _l_o_c_a_l_h_o_s_t_s, _l_o_c_a_l_n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, or _l_o_c_a_l_g_a_t_e_-
     _w_a_y_s are present in the current directory, the file's con-
     tents is prepended to the output file.  Of these, only the
     gateways file is interpreted.  This allows sites to maintain
     local aliases and entries which are not normally present in
     the master database.  Only one gateway to each network will
     be placed in the gateways file; a gateway listed in the
     localgateways file will override any in the input file.

     If the gateways file is to be used, a list of networks to
     which the host is directly connected is specified with the
     -c flag.  The networks, separated by commas, may be given by
     name or in Internet-standard dot notation, e.g.  -c
     arpanet,128.32,local-ether-net.  _H_t_a_b_l_e only includes gate-
     ways which are directly connected to one of the networks
     specified, or which can be reached from another gateway on a
     connected net.

     If the -l option is given with a list of networks (in the
     same format as for -c), these networks will be treated as
     ``local,'' and information about hosts on local networks is
     taken only from the localhosts file.  Entries for local
     hosts from the main database will be omitted.  This allows
     the localhosts file to completely override any entries in
     the input file.

     _H_t_a_b_l_e is best used in conjunction with the _g_e_t_t_a_b_l_e(8C)
     program which retrieves the NIC database from a host.
