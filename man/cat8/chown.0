NAME
     chown - change owner

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/sbin/chown [ -f -R ] owner[.group] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _C_h_o_w_n changes the owner of the _f_i_l_e_s to _o_w_n_e_r.  The owner
     may be either a decimal UID or a login name found in the
     password file.  An optional group may also be specified.
     The group may be either a decimal GID or a group name found
     in the group-ID file.

     Only the super-user can change owner, in order to simplify
     accounting procedures.  No errors are reported when the -f
     (force) option is given.

     When the -R option is given, _c_h_o_w_n recursively descends its
     directory arguments setting the specified owner.  When sym-
     bolic links are encountered, their ownership is changed, but
     they are not traversed.

FILES
     /etc/passwd
