CRON(8)             UNIX Programmer's Manual              CRON(8)



NAME
     cron - daemon to execute scheduled commands (Vixie Cron)

SYNOPSIS
     cron

DESCRIPTION
     _C_r_o_n should be started from /etc/rc or /etc/rc.local.  It
     will return immediately, so you don't need to start it with
     '&'.

     _C_r_o_n searches /var/cron/tabs for crontab files which are
     named after accounts in /etc/passwd; crontabs found are
     loaded into memory.  _C_r_o_n also searches for /etc/crontab
     which is in a different format (see _c_r_o_n_t_a_b(_5)).  _C_r_o_n then
     wakes up every minute, examining all stored crontabs, check-
     ing each command to see if it should be run in the current
     minute.  When executing commands, any output is mailed to
     the owner of the crontab (or to the user named in the MAILTO
     environment variable in the crontab, if such exists).

     Additionally, _c_r_o_n checks each minute to see if its spool
     directory's modtime (or the modtime on /_e_t_c/_c_r_o_n_t_a_b) has
     changed, and if it has, _c_r_o_n will then examine the modtime
     on all crontabs and reload those which have changed.  Thus
     _c_r_o_n need not be restarted whenever a crontab file is modi-
     fied.  Note that the _C_r_o_n_t_a_b(1) command updates the modtime
     of the spool directory whenever it changes a crontab.
