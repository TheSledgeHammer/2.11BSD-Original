MKFS(8)             UNIX Programmer's Manual		  MKFS(8)



NAME
     mkfs - construct a file system

SYNOPSIS
     /sbin/mkfs [ -i bytes ] [ -s size ] [ -m gap ] [ -n modulus
     ] special

DESCRIPTION
     N.B.: file systems are normally created with the _n_e_w_f_s(8)
     command.

     _M_k_f_s constructs a file system by writing on the special file
     _s_p_e_c_i_a_l.  The size of the filesystem in logical blocks is
     specified by the -s _s_i_z_e option.  Logical blocks are 1K (2
     sectors) under 2.11BSD.

	  NOTE: The newfs(8) program's -s option is in units of
	  sectors. Newfs(8) converts this to filesystem (logical)
	  blocks for mkfs(8).

     The number of inodes is calculated based on the argument
     _b_y_t_e_s to the -i option.  The default is 4096.  If more
     inodes are desired in a filesystem (there is an absolute
     maximum of 65500) then a lower value for _b_y_t_e_s should be
     used, perhaps 3072 or even 2048.

     The flags -m _g_a_p and -n _m_o_d_u_l_u_s determine the block inter-
     leaving of the freelist that will be constructed, where _g_a_p
     is the distance between successive 1024-byte blocks, and
     _m_o_d_u_l_u_s is the number of blocks before the pattern repeats,
     typically one cylinder.  The optimal values for these param-
     eters vary with the speed and geometry of the disk, as well
     as the speed of the processor. Newfs(8) will calculate the
     correct values in almost all cases from the disklabel.

BUGS
     The _l_o_s_t+_f_o_u_n_d directory is created but the boot block is
     left uninitialized (see disklabel(8).)
