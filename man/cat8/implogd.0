NAME
     implogd - IMP logger process

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/sbin/implogd [ -d ]

DESCRIPTION
     _I_m_p_l_o_g_d is program which logs error messages from the IMP,
     placing them in the file /_u_s_r/_a_d_m/_i_m_p_l_o_g.

     Entries in the file are variable length.  Each log entry has
     a fixed length header of the form:

     struct sockstamp {
	  short     sin_family;
	  u_short   sin_port;
	  struct    in_addr sin_addr;
	  time_t    sin_time;
	  int  sin_len;
     };

     followed, possibly, by the message received from the IMP.
     Each time the logging process is started up it places a time
     stamp entry in the file (a header with _s_i_n__l_e_n field set to
     0).

     The logging process will catch only those message from the
     IMP which are not processed by a protocol module, e.g. IP.
     This implies the log should contain only status information
     such as ``IMP going down'' messages, ``host down'' and other
     error messages, and, perhaps, stray NCP messages.
