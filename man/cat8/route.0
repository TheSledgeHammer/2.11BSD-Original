NAME
     route - manually manipulate the routing tables

SYNOPSIS
     /sbin/route [ -f ] [ -n ] [ _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _a_r_g_s ]

DESCRIPTION
     _R_o_u_t_e is a program used to manually manipulate the network
     routing tables.  It normally is not needed, as the system
     routing table management daemon, _r_o_u_t_e_d(8), should tend to
     this task.

     _R_o_u_t_e accepts two commands: _a_d_d, to add a route, and _d_e_l_e_t_e,
     to delete a route.

     All commands have the following syntax:

       /sbin/route _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [ net | host ] _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n _g_a_t_e_w_a_y [
     _m_e_t_r_i_c ]

     where _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n is the destination host or network, _g_a_t_e_-
     _w_a_y is the next-hop gateway to which packets should be
     addressed, and _m_e_t_r_i_c is a count indicating the number of
     hops to the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n.  The metric is required for _a_d_d
     commands; it must be zero if the destination is on a
     directly-attached network, and nonzero if the route utilizes
     one or more gateways.  If adding a route with metric 0, the
     gateway given is the address of this host on the common net-
     work, indicating the interface to be used for transmission.
     Routes to a particular host are distinguished from those to
     a network by interpreting the Internet address associated
     with _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n.	The optional keywords net and host force
     the destination to be interpreted as a network or a host,
     respectively.  Otherwise, if the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n has a ``local
     address part'' of INADDR_ANY, or if the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n is the
     symbolic name of a network, then the route is assumed to be
     to a network; otherwise, it is presumed to be a route to a
     host.  If the route is to a destination connected via a
     gateway, the _m_e_t_r_i_c should be greater than 0.  All symbolic
     names specified for a _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n or _g_a_t_e_w_a_y are looked up
     first as a host name using _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_n_a_m_e(3N).  If this
     lookup fails, _g_e_t_n_e_t_b_y_n_a_m_e(3N) is then used to interpret the
     name as that of a network.

     _R_o_u_t_e uses a raw socket and the SIOCADDRT and SIOCDELRT
     _i_o_c_t_l's to do its work.  As such, only the super-user may
     modify the routing tables.

     If the -f option is specified, _r_o_u_t_e will ``flush'' the
     routing tables of all gateway entries.  If this is used in
     conjunction with one of the commands described above, the
     tables are flushed prior to the command's application.

     The -n option prevents attempts to print host and network
     names symbolically when reporting actions.

DIAGNOSTICS
     ``add [ host | network ] %s: gateway %s flags %x''
     The specified route is being added to the tables.	The
     values printed are from the routing table entry supplied in
     the _i_o_c_t_l call.  If the gateway address used was not the
     primary address of the gateway (the first one returned by
     _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_n_a_m_e), the gateway address is printed numerically
     as well as symbolically.

     ``delete [ host | network ] %s: gateway %s flags %x''
     As above, but when deleting an entry.

     ``%s %s done''
     When the -f flag is specified, each routing table entry
     deleted is indicated with a message of this form.

     ``Network is unreachable''
     An attempt to add a route failed because the gateway listed
     was not on a directly-connected network.  The next-hop gate-
     way must be given.

     ``not in table''
     A delete operation was attempted for an entry which wasn't
     present in the tables.

     ``routing table overflow''
     An add operation was attempted, but the system was low on
     resources and was unable to allocate memory to create the
     new entry.
