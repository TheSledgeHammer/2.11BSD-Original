NAME
     syslogd - log systems messages

SYNOPSIS
     syslogd [ -f_c_o_n_f_i_g_f_i_l_e ] [ -m_m_a_r_k_i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l ] [ -d ]

DESCRIPTION
     _S_y_s_l_o_g_d reads and logs messages into a set of files
     described by the configuration file /etc/syslog.conf.  Each
     message is one line.  A message can contain a priority code,
     marked by a number in angle braces at the beginning of the
     line.  Priorities are defined in <_s_y_s/_s_y_s_l_o_g._h>.  _S_y_s_l_o_g_d
     reads from the UNIX domain socket /_d_e_v/_l_o_g, from an Internet
     domain socket specified in /_e_t_c/_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s, and from the spe-
     cial device /_d_e_v/_k_l_o_g (to read kernel messages).

     _S_y_s_l_o_g_d configures when it starts up and whenever it
     receives a hangup signal.	Lines in the configuration file
     have a _s_e_l_e_c_t_o_r to determine the message priorities to which
     the line applies and an _a_c_t_i_o_n.  The _a_c_t_i_o_n field are
     separated from the selector by one or more tabs.

     Selectors are semicolon separated lists of priority specif-
     iers.  Each priority has a _f_a_c_i_l_i_t_y describing the part of
     the system that generated the message, a dot, and a _l_e_v_e_l
     indicating the severity of the message.  Symbolic names may
     be used.  An asterisk selects all facilities.  All messages
     of the specified level or higher (greater severity) are
     selected.	More than one facility may be selected using com-
     mas to separate them.  For example:

	  *.emerg;mail,daemon.crit

     Selects all facilities at the _e_m_e_r_g level and the _m_a_i_l and
     _d_a_e_m_o_n facilities at the _c_r_i_t level.

     Known facilities and levels recognized by _s_y_s_l_o_g_d are those
     listed in _s_y_s_l_o_g(3) without the leading ``LOG_''.	The addi-
     tional facility ``mark'' has a message at priority LOG_INFO
     sent to it every 20 minutes (this may be changed with the -m
     flag).  The ``mark'' facility is not enabled by a facility
     field containing an asterisk.  The level ``none'' may be
     used to disable a particular facility.  For example,

	  *.debug;mail.none

     Sends all messages _e_x_c_e_p_t mail messages to the selected
     file.

     The second part of each line describes where the message is
     to be logged if this line is selected.  There are four
     forms:

     o+	A filename (beginning with a leading slash).  The file
	will be opened in append mode.

     o+	A hostname preceeded by an at sign (``@'').  Selected
	messages are forwarded to the _s_y_s_l_o_g_d on the named host.

     o+	A comma separated list of users.  Selected messages are
	written to those users if they are logged in.

     o+	An asterisk.  Selected messages are written to all
	logged-in users.

     Blank lines and lines beginning with `#' are ignored.

     For example, the configuration file:

	 kern,mark.debug	/dev/console
	 *.notice;mail.info	/usr/spool/adm/syslog
	 *.crit                 /usr/adm/critical
	 kern.err		@ucbarpa
	 *.emerg		*
	 *.alert		eric,kridle
	 *.alert;auth.warning	ralph

     logs all kernel messages and 20 minute marks onto the system
     console, all notice (or higher) level messages and all mail
     system messages except debug messages into the file
     /usr/spool/adm/syslog, and all critical messages into
     /usr/adm/critical; kernel messages of error severity or
     higher are forwarded to ucbarpa.  All users will be informed
     of any emergency messages, the users ``eric'' and ``kridle''
     will be informed of any alert messages, and the user
     ``ralph'' will be informed of any alert message, or any
     warning message (or higher) from the authorization system.

     The flags are:

     -f   Specify an alternate configuration file.

     -m   Select the number of minutes between mark messages.

     -d   Turn on debugging.

     _S_y_s_l_o_g_d creates the file /var/run/syslog.pid, if possible,
     containing a single line with its process id.  This can be
     used to kill or reconfigure _s_y_s_l_o_g_d.

     To bring _s_y_s_l_o_g_d down, it should be sent a terminate signal
     (e.g. kill `cat /var/run/syslog.pid`).
