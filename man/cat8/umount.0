NAME
     umount - unmount file systems

SYNOPSIS
     umount [ -fv ] _s_p_e_c_i_a_l | _n_o_d_e
     umount -a [ -fv ] [ -t _u_f_s | _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l__t_y_p_e ]

DESCRIPTION
     The umount command calls the umount(2) system call to remove
     a _s_p_e_c_i_a_l _d_e_v_i_c_e from the file system tree at the point
     _n_o_d_e.  If either _s_p_e_c_i_a_l or _n_o_d_e are not provided, the
     appropriate information is taken from the fstab(5) file.

     The options are as follows:


     -a        All of the file systems described in fstab(5) are
	       unmounted.

     -f        The file system is forcibly unmounted.  Active
	       special devices continue to work, but all other
	       files return errors if further accesses are
	       attempted.  The root file system cannot be forci-
	       bly unmounted.  This is not currently implemented
	       in 2.11BSD.

     -t _u_f_s | _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l _t_y_p_e
	       Is used to indicate the actions should only be
	       taken on filesystems of the specified type.  More
	       than one type may be specified in a comma
	       separated list.	The list of filesystem types can
	       be prefixed with no to specify the filesystem
	       types for which action should not be taken.  For
	       example, the umount command:

	       umount -a -t nfs,mfs

	       umounts all filesystems of the type NFS and MFS.

	       NOTE: Only UFS is supported by 2.11BSD.	The exam-
	       ple is for illustrative purposes only.

     -v        Verbose, additional information is printed out as
	       each file system is unmounted.
