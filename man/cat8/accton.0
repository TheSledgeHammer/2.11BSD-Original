NAME
     accton - enable/disable system accounting

SYNOPSIS
     accton [-f file] [-r resum] [-s suspend] [-t freq]
     [filename]

DESCRIPTION
     With no argument, accton will disable system accounting.  If
     the -f option is given or the last argument is an existing
     pathname accounting is enabled and for every process which
     terminates under normal conditions an accounting record is
     sent to the accounting daemon.

     accton is a frontend to  the accounting daemon: acctd(8).
     Accounting is turned off by sending a SIGTERM to the running
     accounting daemon.  Changes in configuration (free space
     thresholds, etc) are made by writing /etc/acctd.cf and issu-
     ing a SIGHUP to the accounting daemon.  If the daemon is not
     running it is started.

     The options are:

     -f file   Specifies the name of an existing file to which
	       accounting records are to be appended.  If this
	       option and a trailing filename (the historical
	       form of use) is given then the last filename given
	       is  used.

     -r resum  Percentage of diskspace that must be free in order
	       for accounting to be resumed.  The default is 4%.

     -s susp   If the percentage of free diskspace falls below
	       susp accounting is suspended.  The default is 2%.

     -t freq   How often (in seconds) to check the free diskpace.
	       Default is 30.

FILES
     /usr/libexec/acctd  The accounting daemon that reads
			 /dev/acct

     /etc/acctd.cf	 The configuration file.  Must be owned
			 by root and writeable only by root.
			 This file, while simple text, is not
			 meant for human editing since the parse
			 is simpleminded and the daemon is
			 paranoid.
