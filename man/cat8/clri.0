NAME
     clri - clear i-node

SYNOPSIS
     clri filesystem i-number ...

DESCRIPTION
     _C_l_r_i writes zeros on the i-nodes with the decimal _i-_n_u_m_b_e_r_s
     on the _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m. After _c_l_r_i, any blocks in the affected
     file will show up as `missing' in an _i_c_h_e_c_k(8) of the
     _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m.

     Read and write permission is required on the specified file
     system device.  The i-node becomes allocatable.

     The primary purpose of this routine is to remove a file
     which for some reason appears in no directory.  If it is
     used to zap an i-node which does appear in a directory, care
     should be taken to track down the entry and remove it.  Oth-
     erwise, when the i-node is reallocated to some new file, the
     old entry will still point to that file.  At that point
     removing the old entry will destroy the new file.	The new
     entry will again point to an unallocated i-node, so the
     whole cycle is likely to be repeated again and again.

SEE ALSO
     fsck(8), icheck(8)

BUGS
     If the file is open, _c_l_r_i is likely to be ineffective.
