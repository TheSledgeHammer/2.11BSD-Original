NAME
     timedc - timed control program

SYNOPSIS
     timedc [ command [ argument ... ] ]

DESCRIPTION
     _T_i_m_e_d_c is used to control the operation of  the  _t_i_m_e_d  pro-
     gram.  It may be used to:

     o+	  measure the differences between machines' clocks,

     o+	  find the location where the master time server is  run-
	  ning,

     o+	  enable or  disable  tracing  of  messages  received  by
	  _t_i_m_e_d, and

     o+	  perform various debugging actions.

     Without any arguments, _t_i_m_e_d_c will prompt for commands  from
     the  standard  input.   If  arguments  are  supplied, _t_i_m_e_d_c
     interprets the first argument as a command and the remaining
     arguments	as parameters to the command.  The standard input
     may be redirected causing _t_i_m_e_d_c to  read	commands  from	a
     file.  Commands may be abbreviated; recognized commands are:

     ? [ command ... ]

     help [ command ... ]
	  Print a short description of each command specified  in
	  the  argument  list,	or,  if no arguments are given, a
	  list of the recognized commands.

     clockdiff host ...
	  Compute the differences between the clock of	the  host
	  machine  and	the clocks of the machines given as argu-
	  ments.

     trace { on | off }
	  Enable or disable the tracing of incoming  messages  to
	  _t_i_m_e_d in the file /usr/adm/timed.log.

     quit
	  Exit from timedc.

     Other commands may be included for use in testing and debug-
     ging  _t_i_m_e_d;  the help command and the program source may be
     consulted for details.
