NAME
     mkhosts - generate hashed host table

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/sbin/mkhosts [ -v ] hostfile

DESCRIPTION
     _M_k_h_o_s_t_s is used to generated the hashed host database used
     by one version of the library routines gethostbyaddr() and
     gethostbyname().  It is not used if host name translation is
     performed by _n_a_m_e_d(8).  If the -v option is supplied, each
     host will be listed as it is added.  The file _h_o_s_t_f_i_l_e is
     usually /etc/hosts, and in any case must be in the format of
     /etc/hosts (see hosts(5)).  _M_k_h_o_s_t_s will generate database
     files named _h_o_s_t_f_i_l_e._p_a_g and _h_o_s_t_f_i_l_e._d_i_r. The new database
     is build in a set of temporary files and only replaces the
     real database if the new one is built without errors.
     _M_k_h_o_s_t_s will exit with a non-zero exit code if any errors
     are detected.

FILES
     _h_o_s_t_f_i_l_e.pag	 - real database filenames
     _h_o_s_t_f_i_l_e.dir
     _h_o_s_t_f_i_l_e.new.pag	 - temporary database filenames
     _h_o_s_t_f_i_l_e.new.dir
