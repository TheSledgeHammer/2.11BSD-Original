NAME
     quot - summarize file system ownership

SYNOPSIS
     quot [ option ] ...  [ filesystem ]

DESCRIPTION
     _Q_u_o_t prints the number of blocks in the named _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m
     currently owned by each user.  If no _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m is named, a
     default name is assumed.  The following options are avail-
     able:

     -n   Cause the pipeline _n_c_h_e_c_k _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m | _s_o_r_t +_0_n | _q_u_o_t
	  -_n _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m to produce a list of all files and their
	  owners.

     -c   Print three columns giving file size in blocks, number
	  of files of that size, and cumulative total of blocks
	  in that size or smaller file.

     -f   Print count of number of files as well as space owned
	  by each user.

FILES
     /etc/passwd    to get user names

SEE ALSO
     du(1), ls(1)

BUGS
     Default file systems vary with installations.  Holes in
     files are counted as if they actually occupied space.
