NAME
     newfs - construct a new file system

SYNOPSIS
     /sbin/newfs [ -N ] [ -m free-gap ] [ -n free-modulus ] [ -i
     bytes ] [ -s size ] [ -T disk-type ] special

DESCRIPTION
     Newfs is a ``friendly'' front-end to the mkfs(8) program.
     Newfs(8) will normally read the disklabel from the drive to
     determine the partition sizes.  If the driver for the disk
     does not support disklabels the -T option must be used to
     force a search of /_e_t_c/_d_i_s_k_t_a_b for partition information
     about _d_r_i_v_e-_t_y_p_e.	Newfs calculates the appropriate parame-
     ters to use in calling mkfs, then builds the file system by
     forking mkfs.

     -N causes the mkfs command which would be executed to be
     printed out without actually creating the file system.  The
     disk specified by special must be online though so that
     newfs can read the disklabel.

     -m allows the specification of the block interleaving of the
     free list.  If not specified or outside the range 1 thru 32
     then a value of 2 is used.

     -n parameter is the freelist modulus (when the -m pattern
     repeats) and is calculated by newfs to be 1 cylinder in size
     by default.

     -i specifies how many bytes per inode to assume when calcu-
     lating how many inodes to allocate.  The default is 4096
     bytes per inode.  If this results in too few inodes being
     allocated (there is an absolute maximum of 65500) then
     decrease the _b_y_t_e_s number (which must lie between 512 and
     65536).

     -T must be used if the disk specified by _s_p_e_c_i_a_l has not
     been labeled with the disklabel(8) program.  In this case
     _d_i_s_k-_t_y_p_e is used by getdisklabel(3) when searching
     /_e_t_c/_d_i_s_k_t_a_b.  This option is used when the underlying dev-
     ice driver does not support disklabels.  Care must be taken
     that the contents of /etc/disktab match the partition tables
     in the kernel.

     -s specifies how many sectors the file system is to contain.
     There are two sectors per file system block, therefore _s_i_z_e
     should be even.  This parameter must be less than or equal
     to the partition size (as determined from the disklabel or
     /etc/disktab).  An error is printed and no action is taken
     if the partition size is 0 or too large.

	  NOTE: Mkfs deals in units of filesystem blocks not sec-
	  tors.  Newfs uses sectors.

FILES
     /etc/disktab   disk geometry and partition information
     mkfs to actually build the file system

SEE ALSO
     getdisklabel(3), disklabel(8), disktab(5), diskpart(8),
     fs(5), fsck(8), mkfs(8)

BUGS
     newfs(8) no longer places boot blocks on the filesystem.
     That duty has been moved to the disklabel(8) program.  If
     you must place a boot block on a disk whose driver does not
     support disklabels use dd(1).
