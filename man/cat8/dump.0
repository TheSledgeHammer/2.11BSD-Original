NAME
     dump - incremental file system dump

SYNOPSIS
     dump [0123456789BchfusTdWwn [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t ...]] [filesystem]

DESCRIPTION
     _D_u_m_p copies to magnetic tape all files changed after a cer-
     tain date in the _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m.

     The following options are supported by dump:

     0-9  This number is the `dump level'.  All files modified
	  since the last date stored in the file /_e_t_c/_d_u_m_p_d_a_t_e_s
	  for the same filesystem at lesser levels will be
	  dumped.  If no date is determined by the level, the
	  beginning of time is assumed; thus the option 0 causes
	  the entire filesystem to be dumped.

     B records
	  The number of dump records per volume.  This option
	  overrides the calculation of tape size based on length
	  and density.

     c	  This option requires no further options.  Used to
	  specify that the tape is a _c_a_r_t_r_i_d_g_e drive rather than
	  a 9-track.

     h level
	  Honor the user 'nodump' flags only for dumps at or
	  above the given level.  The default honor level is 1,
	  so that incremental backups omit such files but full
	  backups retain them.

     f	  Place the dump on the next _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t file instead of the
	  tape.  If '-' is given then standard out (stdout) is
	  written to.

     u	  If the dump completes successfully, write the date of
	  the beginning of the dump on file /_e_t_c/_d_u_m_p_d_a_t_e_s. This
	  file records a separate date for each filesystem and
	  each dump level.  The format of /_e_t_c/_d_u_m_p_d_a_t_e_s is read-
	  able by people, consisting of one free format record
	  per line: filesystem name, increment level and _c_t_i_m_e(_3)
	  format dump date. /_e_t_c/_d_u_m_p_d_a_t_e_s may be edited to
	  change any of the fields, if necessary.  Note that
	  /_e_t_c/_d_u_m_p_d_a_t_e_s is in a format different from that which
	  previous versions of _d_u_m_p maintained in /_e_t_c/_d_d_a_t_e,
	  although the information content is identical.

     s	  The size of the dump tape is specified in feet.  The
	  number of feet is taken from the next _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t. When

	  the specified size is reached, _d_u_m_p will wait for reels
	  to be changed.  The default tape size is 2300 feet.

     d	  The density of the tape, expressed in BPI, is taken
	  from the next _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t. This is used in calculating the
	  amount of tape used per reel. The default is 1600.

     T date
	  Use the specified date as the starting time for the
	  dump instead of the time determined from looking in
	  /etc/dumpdates.  The format of date is the same as that
	  of _c_t_i_m_e(_3).	This option is useful for automated dump
	  scripts that wish to dump over a specific period of
	  time.  The T option is mutually exclusive with the u
	  option.

     W	  _D_u_m_p tells the operator what file systems need to be
	  dumped.  This information is gleaned from the files
	  /_e_t_c/_d_u_m_p_d_a_t_e_s and /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b. The W option causes _d_u_m_p
	  to print out, for each file system in /_e_t_c/_d_u_m_p_d_a_t_e_s
	  the most recent dump date and level, and highlights
	  those file systems that should be dumped.  If the W
	  option is set, all other options are ignored, and _d_u_m_p
	  exits immediately.

     w	  Is like W, but prints only those filesystems which need
	  to be dumped.

     n	  Whenever _d_u_m_p requires operator attention, notify by
	  means similar to a _w_a_l_l(_1) all of the operators in the
	  group "operator".

     If no arguments are given, the _k_e_y is assumed to be 9u and a
     default file system is dumped to the default tape.

     _D_u_m_p requires operator intervention on these conditions: end
     of tape, end of dump, tape write error, tape open error or
     disk read error (if there are more than a threshold of 32).
     In addition to alerting all operators implied by the n key,
     _d_u_m_p interacts with the operator on _d_u_m_p'_s control terminal
     at times when _d_u_m_p can no longer proceed, or if something is
     grossly wrong.  All questions _d_u_m_p poses must be answered by
     typing "yes" or "no", appropriately.

     Since making a dump involves a lot of time and effort for
     full dumps, _d_u_m_p checkpoints itself at the start of each
     tape volume.  If writing that volume fails for some reason,
     _d_u_m_p will, with operator permission, restart itself from the
     checkpoint after the old tape has been rewound and removed,
     and a new tape has been mounted.

     _D_u_m_p tells the operator what is going on at periodic inter-
     vals, including usually low estimates of the number of
     blocks to write, the number of tapes it will take, the time
     to completion, and the time to the tape change.  The output
     is verbose, so that others know that the terminal control-
     ling _d_u_m_p is busy, and will be for some time.

     Now a short suggestion on how to perform dumps.  Start with
     a full level 0 dump

	  dump 0un

     Next, dumps of active file systems are taken on a daily
     basis, using a modified Tower of Hanoi algorithm, with this
     sequence of dump levels:
		       3 2 5 4 7 6 9 8 9 9 ...
     For the daily dumps, a set of 10 tapes per dumped file sys-
     tem is used on a cyclical basis.  Each week, a level 1 dump
     is taken, and the daily Hanoi sequence repeats with 3.  For
     weekly dumps, a set of 5 tapes per dumped file system is
     used, also on a cyclical basis.  Each month, a level 0 dump
     is taken on a set of fresh tapes that is saved forever.

FILES
     /dev/rxp0a      default filesystem to dump from
     /dev/rmt0	     default tape unit to dump to
     /etc/ddate      old format dump date record (obsolete after -J option)
     /etc/dumpdates  new format dump date record
     /etc/fstab      Dump table: file systems and frequency
     /etc/group      to find group _o_p_e_r_a_t_o_r

SEE ALSO
     restor(8), rdump(8), dump(5), fstab(5), dumpdir(8)

DIAGNOSTICS
     Many, and verbose.

BUGS
     Sizes are based on 1600 BPI blocked tape; the raw magtape
     device has to be used to approach these densities.  Fewer
     than 32 read errors on the filesystem are ignored.  Each
     reel requires a new process, so parent processes for reels
     already written just hang around until the entire tape is
     written.

     It would be nice if _d_u_m_p knew about the dump sequence, kept
     track of the tapes scribbled on, told the operator which
     tape to mount when, and provided more assistance for the
     operator running _r_e_s_t_o_r.
