NAME
     fingerd - remote user information server

SYNOPSIS
     fingerd [-s][-l][-p _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e ]

DESCRIPTION
     Fingerd is a simple protocol based on _R_F_C_1_1_9_6 that provides
     an interface to the Name and Finger programs at several net-
     work sites.  The program is supposed to return a friendly,
     human-oriented status report on either the system at the
     moment or a particular person in depth.  There is no
     required format and the protocol consists mostly of specify-
     ing a single ``command line''.

     Fingerd listens for TCP requests at port 79.  Once connected
     it reads a single command line terminated by a <CRLF> which
     is passed to _f_i_n_g_e_r(1).  Fingerd closes its connections as
     soon as the output is finished.

     If the line is null (i.e. just a <CRLF> is sent) then _f_i_n_g_e_r
     returns a ``default'' report that lists all people logged
     into the system at that moment.

     If a user name is specified (e.g.	eric<CRLF> ) then the
     response lists more extended information for only that par-
     ticular user, whether logged in or not.  Allowable ``names''
     in the command line include both ``login names'' and ``user
     names''.  If a name is ambiguous, all possible derivations
     are returned.

     The following options may be passed to fingerd as server
     program arguments in /_e_t_c/_i_n_e_t_d._c_o_n_f:

     -s   Enable secure mode.  Queries without a user name are
	  rejected and forwarding of queries to other remote
	  hosts is denied.

     -l   Enable logging.  The name of the host originating the
	  query is reported via _s_y_s_l_o_g(3) at LOG_NOTICE priority.

     -p   Use an alternate program as the local information pro-
	  vider.  The default local program executed by fingerd
	  is _f_i_n_g_e_r(1).  By specifying a customized local server,
	  this option allows a system manager to have more con-
	  trol over what information is provided to remote sites.

     narrow-minded TELNET-protocol user program can result in
     meaningless attempts at option negotiation being sent to the
     server, which will foul up the command line interpretation.
     Fingerd should be taught to filter out IAC's and perhaps
     even respond negatively (IAC WON'T) to all option commands
     received.

HISTORY
     The fingerd command appeared in 4.3BSD.
