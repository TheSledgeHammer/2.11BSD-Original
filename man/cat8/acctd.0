NAME
     acctd - system accounting daemon

SYNOPSIS
     acctd [-d]

DESCRIPTION
     Acctd reads accounting records from the kernel's accounting
     driver (/dev/acctlog) and writes the records to a file for
     later analysis.  The accton(8) program is used to update (or
     create) the config file (/etc/acctd.cf).

     Acctd(8) reads the config file upon startup and reciept of a
     SIGHUP signal.  If a SIGTERM signal is received the account-
     ing file is closed and the daemon exits.  The one option is:

     -d        Enable debugging mode.  Currently no debugging
	       logic is present.

FILES
     /etc/acctd.cf	 The configuration file.  Must be owned
			 by root and writeable only by root.
			 This file, while simple text, is not
			 meant for human editing since the parse
			 is simpleminded and the daemon is
			 paranoid.

SEE ALSO
     acct(5), accton(8), sa(8)

HISTORY
     Acctd first appeared in 2.11BSD
