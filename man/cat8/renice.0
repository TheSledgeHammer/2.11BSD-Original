NAME
     renice - alter priority of running processes

SYNOPSIS
     renice priority [ [ -p ] pid ... ] [ [ -g ] pgrp ... ] [ [
     -u ] user ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _R_e_n_i_c_e alters the scheduling priority of one or more running
     processes.  The _w_h_o parameters are interpreted as process
     ID's, process group ID's, or user names.  _R_e_n_i_c_e'ing a pro-
     cess group causes all processes in the process group to have
     their scheduling priority altered. _R_e_n_i_c_e'ing a user causes
     all processes owned by the user to have their scheduling
     priority altered.	By default, the processes to be affected
     are specified by their process ID's.  To force _w_h_o parame-
     ters to be interpreted as process group ID's, a -g may be
     specified.  To force the _w_h_o parameters to be interpreted as
     user names, a -u may be given.  Supplying -p will reset _w_h_o
     interpretation to be (the default) process ID's.  For exam-
     ple,

	  renice +1 987 -u daemon root -p 32

     would change the priority of process ID's 987 and 32, and
     all processes owned by users daemon and root.

     Users other than the super-user may only alter the priority
     of processes they own, and can only monotonically increase
     their ``nice value'' within the range 0 to PRIO_MAX (20).
     (This prevents overriding administrative fiats.) The super-
     user may alter the priority of any process and set the
     priority to any value in the range PRIO_MIN (-20) to
     PRIO_MAX.	Useful priorities are: 20 (the affected processes
     will run only when nothing else in the system wants to), 0
     (the ``base'' scheduling priority), anything negative (to
     make things go very fast).

FILES
     /etc/passwd    to map user names to user ID's

SEE ALSO
     getpriority(2), setpriority(2)

BUGS
     Non super-users can not increase scheduling priorities of
     their own processes, even if they were the ones that
     decreased the priorities in the first place.
