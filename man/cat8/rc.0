NAME
     rc - command script for auto-reboot and daemons

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/rc
     /etc/rc.local

DESCRIPTION
     _R_c is the command script which controls the automatic reboot
     and _r_c._l_o_c_a_l is the script holding commands which are per-
     tinent only to a specific site.

     When an automatic reboot is in progress, _r_c is invoked with
     the argument _a_u_t_o_b_o_o_t and runs a _f_s_c_k with option -p to
     ``preen'' all the disks of minor inconsistencies resulting
     from the last system shutdown and to check for serious
     inconsistencies caused by hardware or software failure.  If
     this auto-check and repair succeeds, then the second part of
     _r_c is run.

     The second part of _r_c, which is run after a auto-reboot
     succeeds and also if _r_c is invoked when a single user shell
     terminates (see _i_n_i_t(8)), starts all the daemons on the sys-
     tem, preserves editor files and clears the scratch directory
     /tmp. _R_c._l_o_c_a_l is executed immediately before any other com-
     mands after a successful _f_s_c_k.  Normally, the first commands
     placed in the _r_c._l_o_c_a_l file define the machine's name, using
     _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e(1), and save any possible core image that might
     have been generated as a result of a system crash,
     _s_a_v_e_c_o_r_e(8).  The latter command is included in the _r_c._l_o_c_a_l
     file because the directory in which core dumps are saved is
     usually site specific.
