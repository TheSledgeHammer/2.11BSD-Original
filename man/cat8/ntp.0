NAME
     ntp - query an ntp clock

SYNOPSIS
     ntp [-v] [-s] [-f] _h_o_s_t_s...

DESCRIPTION
     _n_t_p sends an ntp packet to the ntp daemon running on each of
     the given hosts.  A daemon fills in fields of the ntp packet
     as per RFC-????  and sends the packet back.  _n_t_p then for-
     mats and prints the result on the standard output.

     The default output shows the delay, offset, and date in
     _c_t_i_m_e() format.

     Options can reset the time of the local system clock.

OPTIONS
     -v   Verbose output, showing the full contents of received
	  ntp packets, plus caluclated offset, displacement, etc.

     -s   Set system time-of-day clock.  Will only happen if time
	  offset is less than compiled-in constant WAYTOBIG
	  (currently 1000 seconds).  Will not happen if remote
	  host is unsynchronized.

     -f   Force setting system clock regardless of offset.  Must
	  be used with -s option.  Still will not reset clock if
	  remote system is unsynchronized.

NTP RESULTS
     The default output for each _h_o_s_t looks like this:
	 128.8.10.1: delay:1.845207 offset:-0.358460  Mon Mar 20 08:05:44 1989

     The verbose output for each _h_o_s_t looks like this:
	 Packet from: [128.8.10.1]
	 Leap 0, version 1, mode Server, poll 6, precision -10 stratum 1 (WWVB)
	 Synch Distance is 0000.1999  0.099991
	 Synch Dispersion is 0000.0000	0.000000
	 Reference Timestamp is a7bea6c3.88b40000 Tue Mar  7 14:06:43 1989
	 Originate Timestamp is a7bea6d7.d7e6e652 Tue Mar  7 14:07:03 1989
	 Receive Timestamp is	a7bea6d7.cf1a0000 Tue Mar  7 14:07:03 1989
	 Transmit Timestamp is	a7bea6d8.0ccc0000 Tue Mar  7 14:07:04 1989
	 Input Timestamp is	a7bea6d8.1a77e5ea Tue Mar  7 14:07:04 1989
	 umd1: delay:0.019028 offset:-0.043890	Tue Mar  7 14:07:04 1989
	   The various fields are interpreted as follows:

     Packet from: [_a_d_d_r_e_s_s]
	  The address that this ntp packet was received from.

     Leap indicator: _n
	  The leap second indicator.  Non-zero if there is to be

	  a leap second added or subtracted at the new year.

     Status: _n

     Stratum: _n (_s_o_u_r_c_e)
	  The stratum of the clock in the NTP hierarchy, along
	  with the source of the clock, either the name of a
	  reference standard (such as WWVB or GOES) or the Inter-
	  net address of the clock that this clock is derived
	  from.

     Poll = _n
	  The desired poll rate of the peer.

     Precision = _e_x_p_o_n_e_n_t (dec)
	  The claimed precision of the clock, in seconds.

     Synchronizing Dist is ???

     Synchronizing Dispersion is ???

     The next five timestamps are given as NTP fixed-point
     values, in both hexadecimal and _c_t_i_m_e(_3).	These are set
     either by this ntp process, or by the server we are quering.

     Reference Timestamp is _h_e_x-_t_i_m_e_s_t_a_m_p  _c_t_i_m_e _s_t_r_i_n_g
	  The last time the server clock was adjusted. (remote
	  time)

     Originate Timestamp is _h_e_x-_t_i_m_e_s_t_a_m_p  _c_t_i_m_e _s_t_r_i_n_g
	  When the ntp request was transmitted by us to the
	  server.  (local time)

     Receive Timestamp is   _h_e_x-_t_i_m_e_s_t_a_m_p  _c_t_i_m_e _s_t_r_i_n_g
	  When the ntp request was received at the server.
	  (remote time)

     Transmit Timestamp is  _h_e_x-_t_i_m_e_s_t_a_m_p  _c_t_i_m_e _s_t_r_i_n_g
	  When the ntp response was transmitted by the server.
	  (remote time)

     Input Timestamp is     _h_e_x-_t_i_m_e_s_t_a_m_p  _c_t_i_m_e _s_t_r_i_n_g
	  When the ntp response was received by us.  (local time)

     _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e: delay:_t_i_m_e offset:_t_i_m_e
	  The summary of the results of the query, giving the
	  hostname of the responding clock (from the command
	  line), the round-trip delay, and the offset between the
	  two clocks (assuming symmetric round-trip times).

BUGS
     Using _n_t_p with the current host will show inaccurate
     results.

     Probably a few others.  Report bugs to Louis A. Mamokos
     (louie@trantor.umd.edu).
