QUOTAON(8)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       QUOTAON(8)



NAME
     quotaon, quotaoff - turn filesystem quotas on and off

SYNOPSIS
     quotaon [-v] _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m ...
     quotaon [-v] -a
     quotaoff [-v] _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m ...
     quotaoff [-v] -a

DESCRIPTION
     Quotaon announces to the system that disk quotas should be
     enabled on one or more filesystems.  Quotaoff announces to
     the system that the specified filesystems should have any
     disk quotas diskquotas turned off.  The filesystems speci-
     fied must have entries in /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b and be mounted.  Quo-
     taon expects each filesystem to have a quota file named _q_u_o_-
     _t_a_s located at the root of the associated file system.
     These defaults may be overridden in /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b.

     Available options:


     -a             If the -a flag is supplied in place of any
		    filesystem names, quotaon/quotaoff will
		    enable/disable all the filesystems indicated
		    in /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b to be read-write with disk quo-
		    tas.

     -v             Causes quotaon and quotaoff to print a mes-
		    sage for each filesystem where quotas are
		    turned on or off.

FILES
     _q_u_o_t_a_s	    at the filesystem root with user quotas

     /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b     filesystem table
