NAME
     gt307 - read and set GT307 clock board

SYNOPSIS
     gt307 [ -d n ] [ -l ] [ yymmddhhmm.ss ]

DESCRIPTION
     The gt307 is used to read and/or set a Computer Products Inc
     GT307 clock calendar board.  If the date argument is not
     given the board is read but not written.

     The options are:

     -d n		 sets Daylight Savings Time (DST) on if n
			 is 1, off if n if 0.

     -l                  switches output between long and short
			 formats.  The short format is suitable
			 for input to the _d_a_t_e(8) command.

     gt307 is a user mode program only (not a standalone/bootable
     program like toyset ).  The kernel does not know how to read
     a GT307 clock.  Thus the recommended use of gt307 is to set
     the system time from within the _r_c(8) file:

	       date `/sbin/gt307 -l`

FILES
     None.

SEE ALSO
     date(8), phys(2), rc(8)

BUGS
     gt307 uses the phys(2) syscall to access the I/O page and
     thus can only be run by the superuser. Making this program
     setuid (so that users can read the GT307 board) could be a
     large threat to system integrity in the event of bugs in the
     program.  It is NOT recommended that gt307 be made setuid.

HISTORY
     The gt307 command first appeared in 2.11BSD.   It was con-
     tributed by Robin Birch
     (robin@falstaf.demon.co.uk).

     The Makefile, manpage and integration into 2.11BSD were done
     by Steven Schultz (sms@moe.2bsd.com).
