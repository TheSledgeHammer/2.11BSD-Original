NAME
     arff, flcopy - archiver and copier for floppy

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/sbin/arff [ key ] [ name ... ]
     /usr/sbin/flcopy [ -h ] [ -t_n ]

DESCRIPTION
     _A_r_f_f saves and restores files on VAX console media (the con-
     sole floppy on the VAX 11/780 and 785, the cassette on the
     11/730, and the console RL02 on the 8600/8650).  Its actions
     are controlled by the _k_e_y argument.  The _k_e_y is a string of
     characters containing at most one function letter and possi-
     bly one or more function modifiers.  Other arguments to the
     command are file names specifying which files are to be
     dumped or restored.  The default options are correct for the
     RX01 floppy on the 780; for other console media, the f and m
     flags are required.

     Files names have restrictions, because of radix50 considera-
     tions.  They must be in the form 1-6 alphanumerics followed
     by "." followed by 0-3 alphanumerics.  Case distinctions are
     lost.  Only the trailing component of a pathname is used.

     The function portion of the key is specified by one of the
     following letters:

     r	     The named files are replaced where found on the
	     floppy, or added taking up the minimal possible por-
	     tion of the first empty spot on the floppy.

     x	     The named files are extracted from the floppy.

     d	     The named files are deleted from the floppy.  Arff
	     will combine contiguous deleted files into one empty
	     entry in the rt-11 directory.

     t	     The names of the specified files are listed each
	     time they occur on the floppy.  If no file argument
	     is given, all of the names on the floppy are listed.

     The following characters may be used in addition to the
     letter which selects the function desired.

     v	       The v (verbose) option, when used with the t func-
	       tion gives more information about the floppy
	       entries than just the name.

     f	       causes _a_r_f_f to use the next argument as the name
	       of the archive instead of /dev/floppy.

     m	       causes _a_r_f_f not to use the mapping algorithm

	       employed in interleaving sectors around a floppy
	       disk.  In conjunction with the f option it may be
	       used for extracting files from rt11 formatted car-
	       tridge disks, for example.  It may also be used to
	       speed up reading from and writing to rx02 floppy
	       disks, by using the `c' device instead of the `b'
	       device.	It must be used with TU58 or RL02 media.

     c	       causes _a_r_f_f to create a new directory on the
	       floppy, effectively deleting all previously exist-
	       ing files.

     _F_l_c_o_p_y copies the console floppy disk (opened as
     `/dev/floppy') to a file created in the current directory,
     named "floppy", then prints the message "Change Floppy, hit
     return when done".  Then _f_l_c_o_p_y copies the local file back
     out to the floppy disk.

     The -h option to _f_l_c_o_p_y causes it to open a file named
     "floppy" in the current directory and copy it to
     /_d_e_v/_f_l_o_p_p_y; the -t option causes only the first _n tracks to
     participate in a copy.

FILES
     /dev/floppy or /dev/rrx??
