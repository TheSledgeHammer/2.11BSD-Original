MKLOST+FOUND(8)     UNIX Programmer's Manual	  MKLOST+FOUND(8)



NAME
     mklost+found - make a lost+found directory for fsck

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/sbin/mklost+found

DESCRIPTION
     A directory _l_o_s_t+_f_o_u_n_d is created in the current directory
     and a number of empty files are created therein and then
     removed so that there will be empty slots for _f_s_c_k(8).

     This command is obsolete because _f_s_c_k(8) automatically
     creates and extends the _l_o_s_t+_f_o_u_n_d directory as needed.

SEE ALSO
     fsck(8), mkfs(8)
