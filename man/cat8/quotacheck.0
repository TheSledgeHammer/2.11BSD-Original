NAME
     quotacheck - filesystem quota consistency checker

SYNOPSIS
     quotacheck [ -v ] _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m ...
     quotacheck [ -v ] -a

DESCRIPTION
     Quotacheck examines each filesystem, builds a table of
     current disk usage, and compares this table against that
     recorded in the disk quota file for the filesystem.  If any
     inconsistencies are detected, both the quota file and the
     current system copy of the incorrect quotas are updated (the
     latter only occurs if an active filesystem is checked).

     Available options:


     -a             If the -a flag is supplied in place of any
		    filesystem names, quotacheck will check all
		    the filesystems indicated in /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b to be
		    read-write with disk quotas.

     -v             quotacheck reports discrepancies between the
		    calculated and recorded disk quotas.

     Parallel passes are run on the filesystems required, using
     the pass numbers in /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b in an identical fashion to
     fsck(8).

     Normally quotacheck operates silently.

     Quotacheck expects each filesystem to be checked to have a
     quota files named _q_u_o_t_a_s located at the root of the associ-
     ated file system.	These defaults may be overridden in
     /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b.  If a file is not present, quotacheck will
     create it.

     Quotacheck is normally run at boot time from the
     /_e_t_c/_r_c._l_o_c_a_l file, see rc(8), before enabling disk quotas
     with quotaon(8).

     Quotacheck accesses the raw device in calculating the actual
     disk usage for each user.	Thus, the filesystems checked
     should be quiescent while quotacheck is running.

FILES

BUGS
     The _q_u_o_t_a_s file may be named arbitrarily but must reside in
     the filesystem for which it contains quota information.
     Quotacheck will give the error:

	  %_s _d_e_v (_0_x%_x) _m_i_s_m_a_t_c_h %_s (_0_x%_x)

     if the _q_u_o_t_a_s file is not in the filesystem being checked.
     This restriction is enforced by the kernel but may be lifted
     in the future.
