NAME
     sysgen - assign DEC standard CSR and vector addresses

SYNOPSIS
     sysgen

DESCRIPTION
     This filter reads DEC Qbus or UNIBUS device names from stan-
     dard input, assigns CSR addresses and interrupt vectors to
     the devices according to the DEC standard algorithm for
     auto-configuration, and prints the resulting list of alloca-
     tions to standard output.

     Floating CSRs and vectors are identified by a trailing
     asterisk.

COMPATIBILITY
     The program attempts to conform to the CONFIG command of the
     VMS SYSGEN program, but has simplified output.  Specifi-
     cally, it does not print information about VMS device naming
     and support.

BUGS
     More device type aliases should be recognized.  There should
     be a ``help'' command to list known devices so that cat'ing
     the _d_e_v_i_c_e_s._h file is not necessary.
