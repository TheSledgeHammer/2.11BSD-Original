ARP(8C)             UNIX Programmer's Manual		  ARP(8C)



NAME
     arp - address resolution display and control

SYNOPSIS
     arp _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e
     arp -a [ _v_m_u_n_i_x ] [ _k_m_e_m ]
     arp -d _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e
     arp -s _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e _e_t_h_e_r__a_d_d_r [ temp ] [ pub ] [ trail ]
     arp -f _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     The _a_r_p program displays and modifies the Internet-to-
     Ethernet address translation tables used by the address
     resolution protocol (_a_r_p(4p)).

     With no flags, the program displays the current ARP entry
     for _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e. The host may be specified by name or by
     number, using Internet dot notation.  With the -a flag, the
     program displays all of the current ARP entries by reading
     the table from the file _k_m_e_m (default /dev/kmem) based on
     the kernel file _v_m_u_n_i_x (default /vmunix).

     With the -d flag, a super-user may delete an entry for the
     host called _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e.

     The -s flag is given to create an ARP entry for the host
     called _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e with the Ethernet address _e_t_h_e_r__a_d_d_r. The
     Ethernet address is given as six hex bytes separated by
     colons.  The entry will be permanent unless the word temp is
     given in the command. If the word pub is given, the entry
     will be "published"; i.e., this system will act as an ARP
     server, responding to requests for _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e even though the
     host address is not its own.  The word trail indicates that
     trailer encapsulations may be sent to this host.

     The -f flag causes the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e to be read and multiple
     entries to be set in the ARP tables.  Entries in the file
     should be of the form

	  _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e _e_t_h_e_r__a_d_d_r [ temp ] [ pub ] [ trail ]

     with argument meanings as given above.
