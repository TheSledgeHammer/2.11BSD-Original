     dev_mkdb

DESCRIPTION
     The dev_mkdb command creates a _d_b_m(3) hash access method
     database in /_v_a_r/_r_u_n/_d_e_v._d_b which contains the names of all
     of the character and block special files in the /_d_e_v direc-
     tory, using the file type and the _s_t__r_d_e_v field as the key.

     field.
