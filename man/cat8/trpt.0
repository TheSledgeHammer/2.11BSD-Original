NAME
     trpt - transliterate protocol trace

SYNOPSIS
     trpt [ -a ] [ -s ]  [ -t ] [ -f ] [ -j ] [ -p hex-address ]
     [ system [ core ] ]

DESCRIPTION
     _T_r_p_t interrogates the buffer of TCP trace records created
     when a socket is marked for "debugging" (see _s_e_t_s_o_c_k_o_p_t(2)),
     and prints a readable description of these records.  When no
     options are supplied, _t_r_p_t prints all the trace records
     found in the system grouped according to TCP connection pro-
     tocol control block (PCB).  The following options may be
     used to alter this behavior.

     -a   in addition to the normal output, print the values of
	  the source and destination addresses for each packet
	  recorded.

     -s   in addition to the normal output, print a detailed
	  description of the packet sequencing information.

     -t   in addition to the normal output, print the values for
	  all timers at each point in the trace.

     -f   follow the trace as it occurs, waiting a short time for
	  additional records each time the end of the log is
	  reached.

     -j   just give a list of the protocol control block
	  addresses for which there are trace records.

     -p   show only trace records associated with the protocol
	  control block, the address of which follows.

     The recommended use of _t_r_p_t is as follows.  Isolate the
     problem and enable debugging on the socket(s) involved in
     the connection.  Find the address of the protocol control
     blocks associated with the sockets using the -A option to
     _n_e_t_s_t_a_t(1).  Then run _t_r_p_t with the -p option, supplying the
     associated protocol control block addresses.  The -f option
     can be used to follow the trace log once the trace is
     located.  If there are many sockets using the debugging
     option, the -j option may be useful in checking to see if
     any trace records are present for the socket in question.
     The

     If debugging is being performed on a system or core file
     other than the default, the last two arguments may be used
     to supplant the defaults.

DIAGNOSTICS
     ``no namelist'' when the system image doesn't contain the
     proper symbols to find the trace buffer; others which should
     be self explanatory.

BUGS
     Should also print the data for each input or output, but
     this is not saved in the race record.

     The output format is inscrutable and should be described
     here.
