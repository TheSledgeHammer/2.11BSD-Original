NAME
     zic - time zone compiler

SYNOPSIS
     zic [ -v ] [ -d _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y ] [ -l _l_o_c_a_l_t_i_m_e ] [ _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e ...
     ]

DESCRIPTION
     _Z_i_c reads text from the file(s) named on the command line
     and creates the time conversion information files specified
     in this input.  If a _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is -, the standard input is
     read.

     These options are available:

     -d _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
	  Create time conversion information files in the named
	  directory rather than in the standard directory named
	  below.

     -l _t_i_m_e_z_o_n_e
	  Use the given time zone as local time.  _Z_i_c will act as
	  if the file contained a link line of the form

	       Link _t_i_m_e_z_o_n_e	   localtime

     -v   Complain if a year that appears in a data file is out-
	  side the range of years representable by _t_i_m_e(2)
	  values.

	  Input lines are made up of fields.  Fields are
	  separated from one another by any number of white space
	  characters.  Leading and trailing white space on input
	  lines is ignored.  An unquoted sharp character (#) in
	  the input introduces a comment which extends to the end
	  of the line the sharp character appears on.  White
	  space characters and sharp characters may be enclosed
	  in double quotes (") if they're to be used as part of a
	  field.  Any line that is blank (after comment strip-
	  ping) is ignored.  Non-blank lines are expected to be
	  of one of three types: rule lines, zone lines, and link
	  lines.

     A rule line has the form

	  Rule	NAME  FROM  TO	  TYPE	IN   ON       AT    SAVE  LETTER/S

     For example:

	  Rule	USA   1969  1973  -	Apr  lastSun  2:00  1:00  D

     The fields that make up a rule line are:

     NAME    Gives the (arbitrary) name of the set of rules this
	     rule is part of.

     FROM    Gives the first year in which the rule applies.  The
	     word minimum (or an abbreviation) means the minimum
	     year with a representable time value.  The word max-
	     imum (or an abbreviation) means the maximum year
	     with a representable time value.

     TO      Gives the final year in which the rule applies.  In
	     addition to minimum and maximum (as above), the word
	     only (or an abbreviation) may be used to repeat the
	     value of the FROM field.

     TYPE    Gives the type of year in which the year applies.
	     If TYPE is - then the rule applies in all years
	     between FROM and TO inclusive; if TYPE is uspres,
	     the rule applies in U.S. Presidential election
	     years; if TYPE is nonpres, the rule applies in years
	     other than U.S. Presidential election years.  If
	     TYPE is something else, then _z_i_c executes the com-
	     mand
		  yearistype _y_e_a_r _t_y_p_e
	     to check the type of a year: an exit status of zero
	     is taken to mean that the year is of the given type;
	     an exit status of one is taken to mean that the year
	     is not of the given type.

     IN      Names the month in which the rule takes effect.
	     Month names may be abbreviated.

     ON      Gives the day on which the rule takes effect.
	     Recognized forms include:

		  5	   the fifth of the month
		  lastSun  the last Sunday in the month
		  lastMon  the last Monday in the month
		  Sun>=8   first Sunday on or after the eighth
		  Sun<=25  last Sunday on or before the 25th

	     Names of days of the week may be abbreviated or
	     spelled out in full.  Note that there must be no
	     spaces within the ON field.

     AT      Gives the time of day at which the rule takes
	     affect.  Recognized forms include:

		  2	   time in hours
		  2:00	   time in hours and minutes
		  15:00    24-hour format time (for times after noon)
		  1:28:14  time in hours, minutes, and seconds

	     Any of these forms may be followed by the letter w
	     if the given time is local ``wall clock'' time or s
	     if the given time is local ``standard'' time; in the
	     absence of w or s, wall clock time is assumed.

     SAVE    Gives the amount of time to be added to local stan-
	     dard time when the rule is in effect.  This field
	     has the same format as the AT field (although, of
	     course, the w and s suffixes are not used).

     LETTER/S
	     Gives the ``variable part'' (for example, the ``S''
	     or ``D'' in ``EST'' or ``EDT'') of time zone abbre-
	     viations to be used when this rule is in effect.  If
	     this field is -, the variable part is null.

     A zone line has the form

	  Zone	NAME		      GMTOFF  RULES/SAVE  FORMAT  [UNTIL]

     For example:

	  Zone	Australia/South-west  9:30    Aus	  CST	  1987 Mar 15 2:00

     The fields that make up a zone line are:

     NAME  The name of the time zone.  This is the name used in
	   creating the time conversion information file for the
	   zone.

     GMTOFF
	   The amount of time to add to GMT to get standard time
	   in this zone.  This field has the same format as the
	   AT and SAVE fields of rule lines; begin the field with
	   a minus sign if time must be subtracted from GMT.

     RULES/SAVE
	   The name of the rule(s) that apply in the time zone
	   or, alternately, an amount of time to add to local
	   standard time.  If this field is - then standard time
	   always applies in the time zone.

     FORMAT
	   The format for time zone abbreviations in this time
	   zone.  The pair of characters %s is used to show where
	   the ``variable part'' of the time zone abbreviation
	   goes.  UNTIL The time at which the GMT offset or the
	   rule(s) change for a location.  It is specified as a
	   year, a month, a day, and a time of day.  If this is
	   specified, the time zone information is generated from
	   the given GMT offset and rule change until the time
	   specified.

	   The next line must be a ``continuation'' line; this
	   has the same form as a zone line except that the
	   string ``Zone'' and the name are omitted, as the con-
	   tinuation line will place information starting at the
	   time specified as the UNTIL field in the previous line
	   in the file used by the previous line.  Continuation
	   lines may contain an UNTIL field, just as zone lines
	   do, indicating that the next line is a further con-
	   tinuation.

     A link line has the form

	  Link	LINK-FROM   LINK-TO

     For example:

	  Link	US/Eastern  EST5EDT

     The LINK-FROM field should appear as the NAME field in some
     zone line; the LINK-TO field is used as an alternate name
     for that zone.

     Except for continuation lines, lines may appear in any order
     in the input.

NOTE
     For areas with more than two types of local time, you may
     need to use local standard time in the AT field of the ear-
     liest transition time's rule to ensure that the earliest
     transition time recorded in the compiled file is correct.

FILES
     /usr/share/zoneinfostandard directory used for created files
