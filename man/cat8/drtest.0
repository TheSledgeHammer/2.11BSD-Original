NAME
     drtest - standalone disk test program

DESCRIPTION
     _D_r_t_e_s_t is a standalone program used to read a disk track by
     track. It was primarily intended as a test program for new
     standalone drivers, but has shown useful in other contexts
     as well, such as verifying disks and running speed tests.
     For example, when a disk has been formatted (by format(8)),
     you can check that hard errors has been taken care of by
     running _d_r_t_e_s_t.  No hard errors should be found, but in many
     cases quite a few soft ECC errors will be reported.

     While _d_r_t_e_s_t is running, the cylinder number is printed on
     the console for every 10th cylinder read.

EXAMPLE
     A sample run of _d_r_t_e_s_t is shown below. In this example
     (using a 750), _d_r_t_e_s_t is loaded from the root file system;
     usually it will be loaded from the machine's console storage
     device.  Boldface means user input.  As usual, ``#'' and
     ``@'' may be used to edit input.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The diagnostics are intended to be self explanatory. Note,
     however, that the device number in the diagnostic messages
     is identified as  _t_y_p_e_X instead of _t_y_p_e(_a,_u) where _X =
     a*8+u, e.g., hp(1,3) becomes hp11.
