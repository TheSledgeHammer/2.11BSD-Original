NAME
     timed - time server daemon

SYNOPSIS
     timed [ -t ] [ -M ] [ -n network ] [ -i network ]

DESCRIPTION
     _T_i_m_e_d is the time server daemon and is normally  invoked  at
     boot  time  from  the _r_c(8) file. It synchronizes the host's
     time with the time of other machines in a local area network
     running  _t_i_m_e_d(8).   These  time  servers will slow down the
     clocks of some machines and speed up the clocks of others to
     bring them to the average network time.  The average network
     time is computed  from  measurements  of  clock  differences
     using the ICMP timestamp request message.

     The service provided by _t_i_m_e_d is based   on  a  master-slave
     scheme.   When _t_i_m_e_d(8) is started on a machine, it asks the
     master for the network time and sets  the	host's	clock  to
     that  time.  After that, it accepts synchronization messages
     periodically sent by the master and calls _a_d_j_t_i_m_e(2) to per-
     form the needed corrections on the host's clock.

     It also communicates with _d_a_t_e(1) in order to set	the  date
     globally,	and  with _t_i_m_e_d_c(8), a timed control program.  If
     the machine running the master crashes, then the slaves will
     elect  a  new  master  from among slaves running with the -M
     flag.  A _t_i_m_e_d running without the -M  flag  will	remain	a
     slave.   The  -t flag enables _t_i_m_e_d to trace the messages it
     receives in the file  /usr/adm/timed.log.	 Tracing  can  be
     turned  on  or off by the program _t_i_m_e_d_c(8).  _T_i_m_e_d normally
     checks for a master time server on each network to which  it
     is  connected,  except  as modified by the options described
     below.  It will request  synchronization  service	from  the
     first  master  server located.  If permitted by the -M flag,
     it will provide synchronization service on any attached net-
     works  on which no current master server was detected.  Such
     a server propagates the time computed by the top-level  mas-
     ter.   The  -n flag, followed by the name of a network which
     the host is connected to (see  _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s(5)),  overrides  the
     default choice of the network addresses made by the program.
     Each time the -n flag appears, that network name is added to
     a	list  of valid networks.  All other networks are ignored.
     The -i flag, followed by the name of a network to which  the
     host  is  connected (see _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s(5)), overrides the default
     choice of the network addresses made by the  program.   Each
     time  the	-i  flag appears, that network name is added to a
     list of networks to ignore.  All other networks are used  by
     the  time	daemon.   The  -n and -i flags are meaningless if
     used together.
