NAME
     kgmon - generate a dump of the operating system's profile
     buffers

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/sbin/kgmon [ -b ] [ -h ] [ -r ] [ -p ] [ system ] [
     memory ]

DESCRIPTION
     _K_g_m_o_n is a tool used when profiling the operating system.
     When no arguments are supplied, _k_g_m_o_n indicates the state of
     operating system profiling as running, off, or not config-
     ured.  (see _c_o_n_f_i_g(8)) If the -p flag is specified, _k_g_m_o_n
     extracts profile data from the operating system and produces
     a _g_m_o_n._o_u_t file suitable for later analysis by _g_p_r_o_f(1).

     The following options may be specified:

     -b   Resume the collection of profile data.

     -h   Stop the collection of profile data.

     -p   Dump the contents of the profile buffers into a
	  _g_m_o_n._o_u_t file.

     -r   Reset all the profile buffers. If the -p flag is also
	  specified, the _g_m_o_n._o_u_t file is generated before the
	  buffers are reset.

     If neither -b nor -h is specified, the state of profiling
     collection remains unchanged.  For example, if the -p flag
     is specified and profile data is being collected, profiling
     will be momentarily suspended, the operating system profile
     buffers will be dumped, and profiling will be immediately
     resumed.

FILES
     /vmunix - the default system
     /dev/kmem - the default memory

SEE ALSO
     gprof(1), config(8)

DIAGNOSTICS
     Users with only read permission on /dev/kmem cannot change
     the state of profiling collection. They can get a _g_m_o_n._o_u_t
     file with the warning that the data may be inconsistent if
     profiling is in progress.
