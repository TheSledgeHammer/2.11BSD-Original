NAME
     implog - IMP log interpreter

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/sbin/implog [ -D ] [ -f ] [ -c ] [ -r ] [ -l [ _l_i_n_k ] ]
     [ -h _h_o_s_t# ] [ -i _i_m_p# ] [ -t _m_e_s_s_a_g_e-_t_y_p_e ]

DESCRIPTION
     _I_m_p_l_o_g is program which interprets the message log produced
     by _i_m_p_l_o_g_d(8C).

     If no arguments are specified, _i_m_p_l_o_g interprets and prints
     every message present in the message file.  Options may be
     specified to force printing only a subset of the logged mes-
     sages.

     -D   Do not show data messages.

     -f   Follow the logging process in action.  This flags
	  causes _i_m_p_l_o_g to print the current contents of the log
	  file, then check for new logged messages every 5
	  seconds.

     -c   In addition to printing any data messages logged, show
	  the contents of the data in hexadecimal bytes.

     -r   Print the raw imp leader, showing all fields, in addi-
	  tion to the formatted interpretation according to type.

     -l [ _l_i_n_k# ]
	  Show only those messages received on the specified
	  ``link''.  If no value is given for the link, the link
	  number of the IP protocol is assumed.

     -h _h_o_s_t#
	  Show only those messages received from the specified
	  host.  (Usually specified in conjunction with an imp.)

     -i _i_m_p#
	  Show only those messages received from the specified
	  imp.

     -t _m_e_s_s_a_g_e-_t_y_p_e
	  Show only those messages received of the specified mes-
	  sage type.
