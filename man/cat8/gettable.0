NAME
     gettable - get NIC format host tables from a host

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/sbin/gettable [ -v ] _h_o_s_t [ outfile ]

DESCRIPTION
     _G_e_t_t_a_b_l_e is a simple program used to obtain the NIC standard
     host tables from a ``nicname'' server.  The indicated _h_o_s_t
     is queried for the tables.  The tables, if retrieved, are
     placed in the file _o_u_t_f_i_l_e or by default, _h_o_s_t_s._t_x_t.

     The -v option will get just the version number instead of
     the complete host table and put the output in the file _o_u_t_-
     _f_i_l_e or by default, _h_o_s_t_s._v_e_r.

     _G_e_t_t_a_b_l_e operates by opening a TCP connection to the port
     indicated in the service specification for ``nicname''.  A
     request is then made for ``ALL'' names and the resultant
     information is placed in the output file.

     _G_e_t_t_a_b_l_e is best used in conjunction with the _h_t_a_b_l_e(8) pro-
     gram which converts the NIC standard file format to that
     used by the network library lookup routines.

BUGS
     If the name-domain system provided network name mapping well
     as host name mapping, _g_e_t_t_a_b_l_e would no longer be needed.
