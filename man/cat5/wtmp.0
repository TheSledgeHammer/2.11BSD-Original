SYNOPSIS

     This structure gives the name of the special file associated
     with the user's terminal, the user's login name, and the
     time of the login in the form of _t_i_m_e(3C).

     The _w_t_m_p file records all logins and logouts.  A null user
     name indicates a logout on the associated terminal.  Furth-
     ermore, the terminal name `~' indicates that the system was
     rebooted at the indicated time; the adjacent pair of entries
     with terminal names `|' and `{' indicate the system-

     maintained time just before and just after a _d_a_t_e command
     has changed the system's idea of the time.

     _W_t_m_p is maintained by _l_o_g_i_n(1) and _i_n_i_t(8).  Neither of
     these programs creates the file, so if it is removed
     record-keeping is turned off.  It is summarized by _a_c(8).
