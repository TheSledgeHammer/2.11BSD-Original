NAME
     gettytab - terminal configuration data base

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/gettytab

DESCRIPTION
     _G_e_t_t_y_t_a_b is a simplified version of the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5) data base
     used to describe terminal lines.  The initial terminal login
     process _g_e_t_t_y(8) accesses the _g_e_t_t_y_t_a_b file each time it
     starts, allowing simpler reconfiguration of terminal charac-
     teristics.  Each entry in the data base is used to describe
     one class of terminals.

     There is a default terminal class, _d_e_f_a_u_l_t, that is used to
     set global defaults for all other classes.  (That is, the
     _d_e_f_a_u_l_t entry is read, then the entry for the class required
     is used to override particular settings.)

CAPABILITIES
     Refer to _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5) for a description of the file layout.
     The _d_e_f_a_u_l_t column below lists defaults obtained if there is
     no entry in the table obtained, nor one in the special
     _d_e_f_a_u_l_t table.

     pe     bool  false          use printer (hard copy) erase algorithm
     pf     num   0		 delay between first prompt and following flush (seconds)
     ps     bool  false          line connected to a MICOM port selector
     qu     str   ^\		 quit character
     rp     str   ^R		 line retype character
     rw     bool  false          do NOT use raw for input, use cbreak
     sp     num   unused	 line speed (input and output)
     su     str   ^Z		 suspend character
     tc     str   none		 table continuation
     to     num   0		 timeout (seconds)
     tt     str   NULL		 terminal type (for enviroment)
     ub     bool  false          do unbuffered output (of prompts etc)
     we     str   ^W		 word erase character
     xc     bool  false          do NOT echo control chars as ^X
     xf     str   ^S		 XOFF (stop output) character
     xn     str   ^Q		 XON (start output) character

     If no line speed is specified, speed will not be altered
     from that which prevails when getty is entered.  Specifying
     an input or output speed will override line speed for stated
     direction only.

     Terminal modes to be used for the output of the message, for
     input of the login name, and to leave the terminal set as
     upon completion, are derived from the boolean flags speci-
     fied.  If the derivation should prove inadequate, any (or
     all) of these three may be overriden with one of the f0, f1,
     or f2 numeric specifications, which can be used to specify
     (usually in octal, with a leading '0') the exact values of
     the flags.  Local (new tty) flags are set in the top 16 bits
     of this (32 bit) value.

     Should _g_e_t_t_y receive a null character (presumed to indicate
     a line break) it will restart using the table indicated by
     the nx entry. If there is none, it will re-use its original
     table.

     The cl screen clear string may be preceded by a (decimal)
     number of milliseconds of delay required (a la termcap).
     This delay is simulated by repeated use of the pad character
     pc.

GETTYTAB(5)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	      GETTYTAB(5)



     The initial message, and login message, im and lm may
     include the character sequence %h or %t to obtain the host-
     name or tty name respectively.  (%% obtains a single '%'
     character.) The hostname is normally obtained from the sys-
     tem, but may be set by the hn table entry.  In either case
     it may be edited with he.	The he string is a sequence of
     characters, each character that is neither '@' nor '#' is
     copied into the final hostname.  A '@' in the he string,
     causes one character from the real hostname to be copied to
     the final hostname.  A '#' in the he string, causes the next
     character of the real hostname to be skipped.  Surplus '@'
     and '#' characters are ignored.

     When getty execs the login process, given in the lo string
     (usually "/bin/login"), it will have set the enviroment to
     include the terminal type, as indicated by the tt string (if
     it exists).  The ev string, can be used to enter additional
     data into the environment.  It is a list of comma separated
     strings, each of which will presumably be of the form
     _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e.

     If a non-zero timeout is specified, with to, then getty will
     exit within the indicated number of seconds, either having
     received a login name and passed control to _l_o_g_i_n, or having
     received an alarm signal, and exited.  This may be useful to
     hangup dial in lines.

     Output from _g_e_t_t_y is even parity unless op is specified.  Op
     may be specified with ap to allow any parity on input, but
     generate odd parity output.  Note: this only applies while
     getty is being run, terminal driver limitations prevent a
     more complete implementation.  _G_e_t_t_y does not check parity
     of input characters in _R_A_W mode.

SEE ALSO
     login(1), termcap(5), getty(8).

BUGS
     The special characters (erase, kill, etc.) are reset to sys-
     tem defaults by _l_o_g_i_n(1).	In all cases, '#' or '^H' typed
     in a login name will be treated as an erase character, and
     '@' will be treated as a kill character.

     The delay stuff is a real crock.  It has been removed from
     the system entirely.  The he capability is stupid.

     _T_e_r_m_c_a_p format is horrid, something more rational should
     have been chosen.
