NAME
     disktab - disk description file

SYNOPSIS
     #include <disktab.h>

DESCRIPTION
     _D_i_s_k_t_a_b is a simple date base which describes disk
     geometries and disk partition characteristics.  The format
     is patterned after the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5) terminal data base.
     Entries in _d_i_s_k_t_a_b consist of a number of `:' separated
     fields.  The first entry for each disk gives the names which
     are known for the disk, separated by `|' characters.  The
     last name given should be a long name fully identifying the
     disk.

     The following list indicates the normal values stored for
     each disk entry.

     Name  Type  Description
     ns    num	 Number of sectors per track
     nt    num	 Number of tracks per cylinder
     nc    num	 Total number of cylinders on the disk
     b0    str	 Filename of block zero primary bootstrap for device
     ba    num	 Block size for partition `a' (bytes)
     bd    num	 Block size for partition `d' (bytes)
     be    num	 Block size for partition `e' (bytes)
     bf    num	 Block size for partition `f' (bytes)
     bg    num	 Block size for partition `g' (bytes)
     bh    num	 Block size for partition `h' (bytes)
     fa    num	 Fragment size for partition `a' (bytes)
     fd    num	 Fragment size for partition `d' (bytes)
     fe    num	 Fragment size for partition `e' (bytes)
     ff    num	 Fragment size for partition `f' (bytes)
     fg    num	 Fragment size for partition `g' (bytes)
     fh    num	 Fragment size for partition `h' (bytes)
     pa    num	 Size of partition `a' in sectors
     pb    num	 Size of partition `b' in sectors
     pc    num	 Size of partition `c' in sectors
     pd    num	 Size of partition `d' in sectors
     pe    num	 Size of partition `e' in sectors
     pf    num	 Size of partition `f' in sectors
     pg    num	 Size of partition `g' in sectors
     ph    num	 Size of partition `h' in sectors
     se    num	 Sector size in bytes (default 512)
     sf    bool  supports bad144-style bad sector forwarding
     so    bool  partition offsets in sectors
     ty    str	 Type of disk (e.g. removable, winchester)

     _D_i_s_k_t_a_b entries may be automatically generated with the
     _d_i_s_k_p_a_r_t program.
