NAME
     L-devices - UUCP device description file

DESCRIPTION
     The L-devices file is consulted by the UUCP daemon _u_u_c_i_c_o(8)
     under the direction of _L._s_y_s(5) for information on the dev-
     ices that it may use.  Each line describes exactly one dev-
     ice.

     A line in _L-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s has the form:

     Caller  Device  Call_Unit	Class  Dialer  [Expect	Send]....

     Each item can be separated by any number of blanks or tabs.
     Lines beginning with a `#' character are comments; long
     lines can be continued by appending a `\' character to the
     end of the line.

     _C_a_l_l_e_r denotes the type of connection, and must be one of
     the following:

     ACU     Automatic call unit, e.g., autodialing modems such
	     as the Hayes Smartmodem 1200 or Novation ``Smart
	     Cat''.

     DIR     Direct connect; hardwired line (usually RS-232) to a
	     remote system.

     DK      AT&T Datakit.

     MICOM   Micom Terminal switch.

     PAD     X.25 PAD connection.

     PCP     GTE Telenet PC Pursuit.

     SYTEK   Sytek high-speed dedicated modem port connection.

     TCP     Berkeley TCP/IP or 3Com UNET connection. These are
	     mutually exclusive.  Note that listing TCP connec-
	     tions in _L-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s is superfluous; _u_u_c_i_c_o does not
	     even bother to look here since it has all the infor-
	     mation it needs in _L._s_y_s(5).

     _D_e_v_i_c_e is a device file in /dev/ that is opened to use the
     device. The device file must be owned by UUCP, with access
     modes of 0600 or better. (See _c_h_m_o_d(2)).

     _C_a_l_l__U_n_i_t is an optional second device file name.	True
     automatic call units use a separate device file for data and
     for dialing; the _D_e_v_i_c_e field specifies the data port, while
     the _C_a_l_l__u_n_i_t field specifies the dialing port.  If the

     _C_a_l_l__u_n_i_t field is unused, it must not be left empty.
     Insert a dummy entry as a placeholder, such as ``0'' or
     ``unused.''

     _C_l_a_s_s is an integer number that specifies the line baud (for
     dialers and direct lines) or the port number (for network
     connections).

     The _C_l_a_s_s may be preceded by a non-numeric prefix.  This is
     to differentiate among devices that have identical _C_a_l_l_e_r
     and baud, but are distinctly different.  For example,
     ``1200'' could refer to all Bell 212-compatible modems,
     ``V1200'' to Racal-Vadic modems, and ``C1200'' to CCITT
     modems, all at 1200 baud.	Similarly, ``W1200'' could denote
     long distance lines, while ``L1200'' could refer to local
     phone lines.

     _D_i_a_l_e_r applies only to ACU devices. This is the "brand" or
     type of the ACU or modem.

     DF02    DEC DF02 or DF03 modems.

     DF112   Dec DF112 modems. Use a _D_i_a_l_e_r field of DF112T to
	     use tone dialing, or DF112P for pulse dialing.

     att     AT&T 2224 2400 baud modem.

     cds224  Concord Data Systems 224 2400 baud modem.

     dn11    DEC DN11 Unibus dialer.

     hayes   Hayes Smartmodem 1200 and compatible autodialing
	     modems.  Use a _D_i_a_l_e_r field of hayestone to use tone
	     dialing, or hayespulse for pulse dialing.	It is
	     also permissible to include the letters `T' and `P'
	     in the phone number (in _L._s_y_s) to change to tone or
	     pulse midway through dialing.  (Note that a leading
	     `T' or `P' will be interpreted as a dialcode!)

     hayes2400
	     Hayes Smartmodem 2400 and compatible modems.  Use a
	     _D_i_a_l_e_r field of hayes2400tone to use tone dialing,
	     or hayes2400pulse for pulse dialing.

     novation
	     Novation ``Smart Cat'' autodialing modem.

     penril  Penril Corp ``Hayes compatible'' modems (they really
	     aren't or they would use the hayes entry.)

     rvmacs  Racal-Vadic 820 dialer with 831 adapter in a MACS
	     configuration.

     va820   Racal-Vadic 820 dialer with 831 adapter.

	     configuration.

     _E_x_p_e_c_t/_S_e_n_d is an optional _E_x_p_e_c_t/_S_e_n_d script for getting
     through a smart port selector, or for issuing special com-
     mands to the modem.  The syntax is identical to that of the
     Expect/Send script of _L._s_y_s.  The difference is that the _L-
     _d_e_v_i_c_e_s script is used _b_e_f_o_r_e the connection is made, while
     the _L._s_y_s script is used _a_f_t_e_r.
