NAME
     dtab - automatic system configuration device table (2BSD)

DESCRIPTION
     The _d_t_a_b file contains a list of the devices that the _a_u_t_o_-
     _c_o_n_f_i_g(8) program will attempt to attach to the system.

     Each line describes one device which may be present on the
     system; additional devices of the same type require addi-
     tional lines.  The line contains at least six fields
     separated by white space.	Blank lines and comments can
     appear anywhere in the file except between fields; comments
     are delimited by `#' and new line.  The fields are (in
     order):

     dev	 The device name, usually two characters

     unit	 Either a unit number or a `?' indicating
		 automatic selection of unit numbers.

     addr	 The address of the device's first register, as a
		 16-bit octal number.

     vector	 The interrupt vector, in octal.

     BR          The priority at which the device interrupts.

     handler(s)  One or more routine names with which the inter-
		 rupt vector is filled.
