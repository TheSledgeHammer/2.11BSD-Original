NAME
     syserrlst - error message file format

DESCRIPTION
     _m_k_e_r_r_l_s_t(1), creates error message files in the format
     described below.

     An ``error message file'' consists of a header, an array of
     structures specifying the offset and length of each message,
     and the array of message strings separated by newlines.

     The message strings are separated by newlines but the new-
     line characters are not included in the size of the message.
     These newline characters serve only to make the file edit-
     able or printable (after stripping off the header).

     The file format is:

     /*
      * Definitions used by the 'mkerrlst' program which creates error message
      * files.
      *
      * The format of the file created is:
      *
      *   struct    ERRLSTHDR ehdr;
      *   struct    ERRLST  emsg[num_of_messages];
      *   struct    {
      *        char msg[] = "error message string";
      *        char lf = '0;
      *        } [num_of_messages];
      *
      * Note:  the newlines are NOT included in the message lengths, the newlines
      *        are present to make it easy to 'cat' or 'vi' the file.
