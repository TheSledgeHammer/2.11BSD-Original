NAME
     L.cmds - UUCP remote command permissions file

DESCRIPTION
     The _L._c_m_d_s file contains a list of commands, one per line,
     that are permitted for remote execution via _u_u_x(1).

     The default search path is /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb. To change
     the path, include anywhere in the file a line of the form:

	  PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb

     Normally, an acknowledgment is mailed back to the requesting
     site after the command completes. If a command name is suf-
     fixed with ,Error, then an acknowledgment will be mailed
     only if the command fails.  If the command is suffixed with
     ,No, then no acknowledgment will ever be sent. (These
     correspond with the -z and -n options of _u_u_x, respectively.)

     For most sites, _L._c_m_d_s should only include the lines:

	  rmail
	  ruusend

     News sites should add:

	  PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb:/usr/new
	  rnews,Error

     While file names supplied as arguments to _u_u_x commands will
     be checked against the list of accessible directory trees in
     _U_S_E_R_F_I_L_E(5), this check can be easily circumvented and
     should not be depended upon.  In other words, it is unwise
     to include any commands in _L._c_m_d_s that accept local file
     names. In particular, _s_h(1) and _c_s_h(1) are extreme risks.

     It is common (but hazardous) to include _u_u_c_p(1) in _L._c_m_d_s;
     see the NOTES section of _U_S_E_R_F_I_L_E.
