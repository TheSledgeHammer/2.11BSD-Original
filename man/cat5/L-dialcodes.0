NAME
     L-dialcodes - UUCP phone number index file

DESCRIPTION
     The _L-_d_i_a_l_c_o_d_e_s file defines the mapping of strings from the
     phone number field of _L._s_y_s(5) to actual phone numbers.

     Each line in L-dialcodes has the form:

	  alpha_string	phone_number

     The two items can be separated by any number of blanks or
     tabs. Lines beginning with a `#' character are comments.

     A phone number in _L._s_y_s can be preceded by an arbitrary
     alphabetic character string; the string is matched against
     the list of _a_l_p_h_a__s_t_r_i_n_gs in _L-_d_i_a_l_c_o_d_e_s.	If a match is
     found, _p_h_o_n_e__n_u_m_b_e_r is substituted for it. If no match is
     found, the string is discarded.

     _L-_d_i_a_l_c_o_d_e_s is commonly used either of two ways:

     (1) The alphabetic strings are used as prefixes to denote
	 area codes, zones, and other commonly used sequences.
	 For example, if _L-_d_i_a_l_c_o_d_e_s included the following
	 lines:

	  chi  1312
	  mv   1415

     In _L._s_y_s you could enter:

	  chivax Any ACU 1200 chi5551234  ogin:--ogin: nuucp
	  mvpyr  Any ACU 1200 mv5556001   ogin:--ogin: Uuucp

     instead of

	  chivax Any ACU 1200 13125551234  ogin:--ogin: nuucp
	  mvpyr  Any ACU 1200 14155556001  ogin:--ogin: Uuucp

     (2) All phone numbers are placed in _L-_d_i_a_l_c_o_d_e_s, one for
	 each remote site.  _L._s_y_s then refers to these by name.
	 For example, if _L-_d_i_a_l_c_o_d_e_s contains the following
	 lines:

	  chivax    13125551234
	  mvpyr     14155556601

     then _L._s_y_s could have:

	  chivax Any ACU 1200 chivax  ogin:--ogin: nuucp
	  mvpyr  Any ACU 1200 mvpyr   ogin:--ogin: Uuucp

     This scheme allows a site administrator to give users read
     access to the table of phone numbers, while still protecting
     the login/password sequences in _L._s_y_s.
