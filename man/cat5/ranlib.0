NAME
     ranlib - archive (library) table-of-contents format

SYNOPSIS
     #include <ranlib.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The archive table-of-contents command _r_a_n_l_i_b creates a table
     of contents for archives, containing object files, to be
     used by the link-editor _l_d(1).  It operates on archives
     created with the utility _a_r(1).

     The _R_a_n_l_i_b function prepends a new file to the archive which
     has three separate parts.	The first part is a standard
     archive header, which has a special name field,  "__.SYM-
     DEF".

     The second part is a ``long'' followed by a list of ranlib
     structures.  The long is the size, in bytes, of the list of
     ranlib structures.  Each of the ranlib structures consists
     of a zero based offset into the next section (a string table
     of symbols) and an offset from the beginning of the archive
     to the start of the archive file which defines the symbol.
     The actual number of ranlib structures is this number
     divided by the size of an individual ranlib structure.

     The third part is a ``long'' followed by a string table.
     The long is the size, in bytes of the string table.
