NAME
     group - group file

DESCRIPTION
     _G_r_o_u_p contains for each group the following information:

     group name
     encrypted password
     numerical group ID
     a comma separated list of all users allowed in the group

     This is an ASCII file.  The fields are separated by colons;
     Each group is separated from the next by a new-line.  If the
     password field is null, no password is demanded.

     This file resides in directory /etc.  Because of the
     encrypted passwords, it can and does have general read per-
     mission and can be used, for example, to map numerical group
     ID's to names.

FILES
     /etc/group

SEE ALSO
     setgroups(2), initgroups(3X), crypt(3), passwd(1), passwd(5)

BUGS
     The _p_a_s_s_w_d(1) command won't change the passwords.
