NAME
     remote - remote host description file

DESCRIPTION
     The systems known by _t_i_p(1C) and their attributes are stored
     in an ASCII file which is structured somewhat like the
     _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5) file.  Each line in the file provides a descrip-
     tion for a single _s_y_s_t_e_m.	Fields are separated by a colon
     (``:'').  Lines ending in a \ character with an immediately
     following newline are continued on the next line.

     The first entry is the name(s) of the host system.  If there
     is more than one name for a system, the names are separated
     by vertical bars.	After the name of the system comes the
     fields of the description.  A field name followed by an `='
     sign indicates a string value follows.  A field name fol-
     lowed by a `#' sign indicates a following numeric value.

     Entries named ``tip*'' and ``cu*'' are used as default
     entries by _t_i_p, and the _c_u interface to _t_i_p, as follows.
     When _t_i_p is invoked with only a phone number, it looks for
     an entry of the form ``tip300'', where 300 is the baud rate
     with which the connection is to be made.  When the _c_u inter-
     face is used, entries of the form ``cu300'' are used.

CAPABILITIES
     Capabilities are either strings (str), numbers (num), or
     boolean flags (bool).  A string capability is specified by
     _c_a_p_a_b_i_l_i_t_y=_v_a_l_u_e; e.g. ``dv=/dev/harris''.  A numeric capa-
     bility is specified by _c_a_p_a_b_i_l_i_t_y#_v_a_l_u_e; e.g. ``xa#99''.  A
     boolean capability is specified by simply listing the capa-
     bility.

     at   (str) Auto call unit type.

     br   (num) The baud rate used in establishing a connection
	  to the remote host.  This is a decimal number. The
	  default baud rate is 300 baud.

     cm   (str) An initial connection message to be sent to the
	  remote host.	For example, if a host is reached through
	  port selector, this might be set to the appropriate
	  sequence required to switch to the host.

     cu   (str) Call unit if making a phone call.  Default is the
	  same as the `dv' field.

     di   (str) Disconnect message sent to the host when a
	  disconnect is requested by the user.

     du   (bool) This host is on a dial-up line.

     dv   (str) UNIX device(s) to open to establish a connection.
	  If this file refers to a terminal line, _t_i_p(1C)
	  attempts to perform an exclusive open on the device to
	  insure only one user at a time has access to the port.

     el   (str) Characters marking an end-of-line. The default is
	  NULL.  `~' escapes are only recognized by _t_i_p after one
	  of the characters in `el', or after a carriage-return.

     fs   (str) Frame size for transfers. The default frame size
	  is equal to BUFSIZ.

     hd   (bool) The host uses half-duplex communication, local
	  echo should be performed.

     ie   (str) Input end-of-file marks.  The default is NULL.

     oe   (str) Output end-of-file string.  The default is NULL.
	  When _t_i_p is transferring a file, this string is sent at
	  end-of-file.

     pa   (str) The type of parity to use when sending data to
	  the host.  This may be one of ``even'', ``odd'',
	  ``none'', ``zero'' (always set bit 8 to zero), ``one''
	  (always set bit 8 to 1).  The default is even parity.

     pn   (str) Telephone number(s) for this host.  If the tele-
	  phone number field contains an @ sign, _t_i_p searches the
	  file /_e_t_c/_p_h_o_n_e_s file for a list of telephone numbers;
	  c.f.	_p_h_o_n_e_s(5).

     tc   (str) Indicates that the list of capabilities is con-
	  tinued in the named description.  This is used pri-
	  marily to share common capability information.

     Here is a short example showing the use of the capability
     continuation feature:

     UNIX-1200:\
	  :dv=/dev/cau0:el=^D^U^C^S^Q^O@:du:at=ventel:ie=#$%:oe=^D:br#1200:
     arpavax|ax:\
	  :pn=7654321%:tc=UNIX-1200
