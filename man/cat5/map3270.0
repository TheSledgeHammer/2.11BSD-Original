NAME
     map3270 - database for mapping ascii keystrokes into IBM
     3270 keys

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/share/misc/map3270

DESCRIPTION
     When emulating IBM-syle 3270 terminals under UNIX (see
     _t_n_3_2_7_0(1)), a mapping must be performed between sequences of
     keys hit on a user's (ascii) keyboard, and the keys that are
     available on a 3270.  For example, a 3270 has a key labeled
     EEOF which erases the contents of the current field from the
     location of the cursor to the end.  In order to accomplish
     this function, the terminal user and a program emulating a
     3270 must agree on what keys will be typed to invoke the
     EEOF function.

     The requirements for these sequences are:

	 1.)  that the first character of the sequence be outside of the
	      standard ascii printable characters;

	 2.)  that no one sequence _b_e an initial part of another (although
	      sequences may _s_h_a_r_e initial parts).


FORMAT
     The file consists of entries for various terminals.  The
     first part of an entry lists the names of the terminals
     which use that entry.  These names should be the same as in
     /_e_t_c/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p (see _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5)); note that often the terminals
     from various termcap entries will all use the same _m_a_p_3_2_7_0
     entry; for example, both 925 and 925vb (for 925 with visual
     bells) would probably use the same _m_a_p_3_2_7_0 entry.	After the
     names, separated by vertical bars (`|'), comes a left brace
     (`{'); the definitions; and, finally, a right brace (`}').

     The definitions consist of a reserved keyword (see list
     below) which identifies the 3270 function (extended as
     defined below), followed by an equal sign (`='), followed by
     the various ways to generate this particular function, fol-
     lowed by a semi-colon (`;').  Each way is a sequence of
     strings of _p_r_i_n_t_a_b_l_e ascii characters enclosed inside single
     quotes (`''); various ways (options) are separated by verti-
     cal bars (`|').

     Inside the single quotes, a few characters are special.  A
     caret (`^') specifies that the next character is the ``con-
     trol'' character of whatever the character is.  So, `^a'
     represents control-a, ie: hexadecimal 1 (note that `^A'
     would generate the same code). To generate rubout, one

MAP3270(5)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       MAP3270(5)



     enters `^?'.  To represent a control character inside a file
     requires using the caret to represent a control sequence;
     simply typing control-A will not work.  Note: the ctrl-caret
     sequence (to generate a hexadecimal 1E) is represented as
     `^^' (not `^\^').

     In addition to the caret, a letter may be preceeded by a
     backslash (`\').  Since this has little effect for most
     characters, its use is usually not recommended.  For the
     case of a single quote (`''), the backslash prevents that
     single quote from terminating the string.	To have the
     backslash be part of the string, it is necessary to place
     two backslashes ('\\') in the file.

     In addition, the following characters are special:

	  `\E'	means an escape character;
	  `\n'	means newline;
	  `\t'	means tab;
	  `\r'	means carriage return.

     It is not necessary for each character in a string to be
     enclosed within single quotes.  `\E\E\E' means three escape
     characters.

     Comments, which may appear anywhere on a line, begin with a
     hash mark (`#'), and terminate at the end of that line.
     However, comments cannot begin inside a quoted string; a
     hash mark inside a quoted string has no special meaning.

3270 KEYS SUPPORTED
     The following is the list of 3270 key names that are sup-
     ported in this file.  Note that some of the keys don't
     really exist on a 3270.  In particular, the developers of
     this file have relied extensively on the work at the Yale
     University Computer Center with their 3270 emulator which
     runs in an IBM Series/1 front end.  The following list
     corresponds closely to the functions that the developers of
     the Yale code offer in their product.

     In the following list, the starred ("*") functions are not
     supported by _t_n_3_2_7_0(1).  An unsupported function will cause
     _t_n_3_2_7_0(_1) to send a bell sequence to the user's terminal.
