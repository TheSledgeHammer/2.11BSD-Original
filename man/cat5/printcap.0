NAME
     printcap - printer capability data base

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/printcap

DESCRIPTION
     _P_r_i_n_t_c_a_p is a simplified version of the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5) data base
     used   to	describe  line	printers.   The  spooling  system
     accesses the _p_r_i_n_t_c_a_p file every time it is  used,  allowing
     dynamic  addition	and  deletion of printers.  Each entry in
     the data base is used to describe one  printer.   This  data
     base may not be substituted for, as is possible for _t_e_r_m_c_a_p,
     because it may allow accounting to be bypassed.

     The default printer is normally _l_p, though  the  environment
     variable  PRINTER may be used to override this.  Each spool-
     ing utility supports an option, -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r, to allow explicit
     naming of a destination printer.

     Refer to the _4._3_B_S_D _L_i_n_e _P_r_i_n_t_e_r _S_p_o_o_l_e_r _M_a_n_u_a_l for  a  com-
     plete  discussion	on  how  setup	the  database for a given
     printer.

CAPABILITIES
     Refer to _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5) for a description of the file layout.

     If the local line printer driver supports	indentation,  the
     daemon must understand how to invoke it.

FILTERS
     The _l_p_d(8) daemon creates a pipeline of _f_i_l_t_e_r_s  to  process
     files  for  various  printer  types.   The  filters selected
     depend on the flags passed to _l_p_r(1).  The pipeline  set  up
     is:

	  -p   pr | if	 regular text + _p_r(1)
	  none if	 regular text
	  -c   cf	 cifplot
	  -d   df	 DVI (tex)
	  -g   gf	 _p_l_o_t(3)
	  -n   nf	 ditroff
	  -f   rf	 Fortran
	  -t   tf	 troff
	  -v   vf	 raster image

     The if filter is invoked with arguments:

	  _i_f [ -c ] -wwidth -llength -iindent -n  login  -h  host
     acct-file

     The -c flag is passed only if  the  -l  flag  (pass  control
     characters literally) is specified to _l_p_r.  _W_i_d_t_h and _l_e_n_g_t_h
     specify the page width and length (from pw  and  pl  respec-
     tively) in characters.  The -n and -h parameters specify the
     login name and host name of the owner  of	the  job  respec-
     tively.  _A_c_c_t-_f_i_l_e is passed from the af _p_r_i_n_t_c_a_p entry.

     If no if is specified, of is used instead, with the distinc-
     tion  that  of  is  opened only once, while if is opened for
     every  individual	job.   Thus,  if  is  better  suited   to

     performing  accounting.   The of is only given the _w_i_d_t_h and
     _l_e_n_g_t_h flags.

     All other filters are called as:

	  _f_i_l_t_e_r -xwidth -ylength -n login -h host acct-file

     where _w_i_d_t_h and _l_e_n_g_t_h are represented in pixels,	specified
     by the px and py entries respectively.

     All filters take _s_t_d_i_n as the file, _s_t_d_o_u_t as  the  printer,
     may  log  either  to _s_t_d_e_r_r or using _s_y_s_l_o_g(3), and must not
     ignore SIGINT.

LOGGING
     Error messages generated by the line printer programs  them-
     selves  (that  is, the _l_p* programs) are logged by _s_y_s_l_o_g(3)
     using the _L_P_R facility.  Messages printed on _s_t_d_e_r_r  of  one
     of  the  filters are sent to the corresponding lf file.  The
     filters may, of course, use _s_y_s_l_o_g themselves.

     Error messages sent to the console have  a  carriage  return
     and  a  line  feed appended to them, rather than just a line
     feed.
