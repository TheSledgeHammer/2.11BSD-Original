NAME
     networks - network name data base

DESCRIPTION
     The _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s file contains information regarding the known
     networks which comprise the DARPA Internet.  For each net-
     work a single line should be present with the following
     information:

     official network name
     network number
     aliases

     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab char-
     acters.  A ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment; char-
     acters up to the end of the line are not interpreted by rou-
     tines which search the file.  This file is normally created
     from the official network data base maintained at the Net-
     work Information Control Center (NIC), though local changes
     may be required to bring it up to date regarding unofficial
     aliases and/or unknown networks.

     Network number may be specified in the conventional ``.''
     notation using the _i_n_e_t__n_e_t_w_o_r_k() routine from the Internet
     address manipulation library, _i_n_e_t(3N).  Network names may
     contain any printable character other than a field delim-
     iter, newline, or comment character.

FILES
     /etc/networks

SEE ALSO
     getnetent(3N)

BUGS
     A name server should be used instead of a static file.
