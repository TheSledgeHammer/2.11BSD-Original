NAME
     troff, nroff - text formatting and typesetting

SYNOPSIS
     troff [ option ] ...  [ file ] ...

     nroff [ option ] ...  [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _T_r_o_f_f formats text in the named _f_i_l_e_s for printing on a
     Graphic Systems C/A/T phototypesetter; _n_r_o_f_f is used for for
     typewriter-like devices.  Their capabilities are described
     in the _N_r_o_f_f/_T_r_o_f_f _u_s_e_r'_s _m_a_n_u_a_l.

     If no _f_i_l_e argument is present, the standard input is read.
     An argument consisting of a single minus (-) is taken to be
     a file name corresponding to the standard input.  The
     options, which may appear in any order so long as they
     appear before the files, are:

     -o_l_i_s_t Print only pages whose page numbers appear in the
	    comma-separated _l_i_s_t of numbers and ranges.  A range
	    _N-_M means pages _N through _M; an initial -_N means from
	    the beginning to page _N; and a final _N- means from _N
	    to the end.

     -n_N    Number first generated page _N.

     -s_N    Stop every _N pages.  _N_r_o_f_f will halt prior to every _N
	    pages (default _N=1) to allow paper loading or chang-
	    ing, and will resume upon receipt of a newline.
	    _T_r_o_f_f will stop the phototypesetter every _N pages,
	    produce a trailer to allow changing cassettes, and
	    resume when the typesetter's start button is pressed.

     -m_n_a_m_e Prepend the macro file /usr/share/tmac/tmac._n_a_m_e to
	    the input _f_i_l_e_s.

     -r_a_N   Set register _a (one-character) to _N.

     -i     Read standard input after the input files are
	    exhausted.

     -q     Invoke the simultaneous input-output mode of the rd
	    request.

     _T_r_o_f_f _o_n_l_y

     -t     Direct output to the standard output instead of the
	    phototypesetter.

     -f     Refrain from feeding out paper and stopping

	    phototypesetter at the end of the run.

     -w     Wait until phototypesetter is available, if currently
	    busy.

     -b     Report whether the phototypesetter is busy or avail-
	    able.  No text processing is done.

     -a     Send a printable ASCII approximation of the results
	    to the standard output.

     -pN    Print all characters in point size _N while retaining
	    all prescribed spacings and motions, to reduce photo-
	    typesetter elapsed time.

     -F_f_o_n_t_d_i_r
	    The directory _f_o_n_t_d_i_r contains the font width tables
	    instead of the default directory /usr/share/fonts.
	    This option can be used to produce output for devices
	    besides the phototypesetter.

     If the file /_u_s_r/_a_d_m/_t_r_a_c_c_t is writable, _t_r_o_f_f keeps photo-
     typesetter accounting records there.  The integrity of that
     file may be secured by making _t_r_o_f_f a 'set user-id' program.

     /usr/share/tmac/tmac.*  standard macro files
