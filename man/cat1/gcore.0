NAME
     gcore - get core image of running process

SYNOPSIS
     gcore [-s][-c core] _p_i_d

DESCRIPTION
     _g_c_o_r_e creates a core image of each specified process, suit-
     able for use with _a_d_b(1).	By default the core image is
     written to the file <_p_i_d>._c_o_r_e.

     The options are:

     -c   Write the core file to the specified file instead of
	  <_p_i_d>._c_o_r_e.

     -s   Stop the process while creating the core image and
	  resume it when done.	This makes sure that the core
	  dump will be in a consistent state.  The process is
	  resumed even if it was already stopped.  Of course, you
	  can obtain the same result by manually stopping the
	  process with kill(1).

     The core image name was changed from _c_o_r_e.<_p_i_d> to
     <_p_i_d>._c_o_r_e to prevent matching names like _c_o_r_e._h and _c_o_r_e._c
     when using programs such as _f_i_n_d(_1).

FILES
     <process-id>.core	 The core image.

BUGS
     If gcore encounters an error while creating the core image
     and the -s option was used the process will remain stopped.

     Swapped out processes and system processes (the swapper) may
     not be gcore'd.
