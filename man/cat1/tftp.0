NAME
     tftp - trivial file transfer program

SYNOPSIS
     tftp [ host ]

DESCRIPTION
     _T_f_t_p is the user interface to the Internet TFTP (Trivial
     File Transfer Protocol), which allows users to transfer
     files to and from a remote machine.  The remote _h_o_s_t may be
     specified on the command line, in which case _t_f_t_p uses _h_o_s_t
     as the default host for future transfers (see the connect
     command below).

COMMANDS
     Once _t_f_t_p is running, it issues the prompt tftp> and recog-
     nizes the following commands:

     connect _h_o_s_t-_n_a_m_e [ _p_o_r_t ]
	  Set the _h_o_s_t (and optionally _p_o_r_t) for transfers.  Note
	  that the TFTP protocol, unlike the FTP protocol, does
	  not maintain connections betweeen transfers; thus, the
	  _c_o_n_n_e_c_t command does not actually create a connection,
	  but merely remembers what host is to be used for
	  transfers.  You do not have to use the _c_o_n_n_e_c_t command;
	  the remote host can be specified as part of the _g_e_t or
	  _p_u_t commands.

     mode _t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r-_m_o_d_e
	  Set the mode for transfers; _t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r-_m_o_d_e may be one of
	  _a_s_c_i_i or _b_i_n_a_r_y.  The default is _a_s_c_i_i.

     put _f_i_l_e
     put _l_o_c_a_l_f_i_l_e _r_e_m_o_t_e_f_i_l_e
     put _f_i_l_e_1 _f_i_l_e_2 ... _f_i_l_e_N _r_e_m_o_t_e-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
	  Put a file or set of files to the specified remote file
	  or directory.  The destination can be in one of two
	  forms: a filename on the remote host, if the host has
	  already been specified, or a string of the form
	  _h_o_s_t:_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e to specify both a host and filename at
	  the same time.  If the latter form is used, the host-
	  name specified becomes the default for future
	  transfers.  If the remote-directory form is used, the
	  remote host is assumed to be a _U_N_I_X machine.

     get _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
     get _r_e_m_o_t_e_n_a_m_e _l_o_c_a_l_n_a_m_e
     get _f_i_l_e_1 _f_i_l_e_2 ... _f_i_l_e_N
	  Get a file or set of files from the specified _s_o_u_r_c_e_s.
	  _S_o_u_r_c_e can be in one of two forms: a filename on the
	  remote host, if the host has already been specified, or
	  a string of the form _h_o_s_t:_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e to specify both a

	  host and filename at the same time.  If the latter form
	  is used, the last hostname specified becomes the
	  default for future transfers.

     quit Exit _t_f_t_p.  An end of file also exits.

     verbose
	  Toggle verbose mode.

     trace
	  Toggle packet tracing.

     status
	  Show current status.

     rexmt _r_e_t_r_a_n_s_m_i_s_s_i_o_n-_t_i_m_e_o_u_t
	  Set the per-packet retransmission timeout, in seconds.

     timeout _t_o_t_a_l-_t_r_a_n_s_m_i_s_s_i_o_n-_t_i_m_e_o_u_t
	  Set the total transmission timeout, in seconds.

     ascii
	  Shorthand for "mode ascii"

     binary
	  Shorthand for "mode binary"

     ?	[ _c_o_m_m_a_n_d-_n_a_m_e ... ]
	  Print help information.

BUGS
     Because there is no user-login or validation within the _T_F_T_P
     protocol, the remote site will probably have some sort of
     file-access restrictions in place.  The exact methods are
     specific to each site and therefore difficult to document
     here.
