NAME
     last - indicate last logins of users and teletypes

SYNOPSIS
     last [ -f filename ] [ -N ] [ name ...  ] [ tty ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
     _L_a_s_t will look back in the _w_t_m_p file which records all
     logins and logouts for information about a user, a teletype
     or any group of users and teletypes.  Arguments specify
     names of users or teletypes of interest.  Names of teletypes
     may be given fully or abbreviated.  For example `last 0' is
     the same as `last tty0'.  If multiple arguments are given,
     the information which applies to any of the arguments is
     printed.  For example `last root console' would list all of
     "root's" sessions as well as all sessions on the console
     terminal.	_L_a_s_t will print the sessions of the specified
     users and teletypes, most recent first, indicating the times
     at which the session began, the duration of the session, and
     the teletype which the session took place on.  If the ses-
     sion is still continuing or was cut short by a reboot, _l_a_s_t
     so indicates.

     The pseudo-user reboot logs in at reboots of the system,
     thus

	  last reboot

     will give an indication of mean time between reboot.

     _L_a_s_t with no arguments prints a record of all logins and
     logouts, in reverse order.  The -f filename option allows
     the user to examine an alternate _w_t_m_p file.  The -N option
     limits the report to N lines.

     If _l_a_s_t is interrupted, it indicates how far the search has
     progressed in _w_t_m_p. If interrupted with a quit signal (gen-
     erated by a control-\) _l_a_s_t indicates how far the search has
     progressed so far, and the search continues.
