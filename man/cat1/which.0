NAME
     which - locate a program file including aliases and paths
     (_c_s_h only)

SYNOPSIS
     which [ name ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _W_h_i_c_h takes a list of names and looks for the files which
     would be executed had these names been given as commands.
     Each argument is expanded if it is aliased, and searched for
     along the user's path.  Both aliases and path are taken from
     the user's .cshrc file.

FILES
     ~/.cshrc  source of aliases and path values

DIAGNOSTICS
     A diagnostic is given for names which are aliased to more
     than a single word, or if an executable file with the argu-
     ment name was not found in the path.

BUGS
     Must be executed by a csh, since only csh's know about
     aliases.
