NAME
     shar - create file storage archive for extraction by /bin/sh

SYNOPSIS
     shar [-abcmsuv] [-p prefix] [-d delim] files > archive

DESCRIPTION
     _s_h_a_r prints its input files with special command lines
     around them to be used by the shell, /_b_i_n/_s_h , to extract
     the files later.  The output can be filtered through the
     shell to recreate copies of the original files.

     _s_h_a_r allows directories to be named, and _s_h_a_r prints the
     necessary commands (_m_k_d_i_r & _c_d) to create new directories
     and fill them.  _s_h_a_r will not allow existing files to be
     over-written; such files must be removed by the user
     extracting the files.

OPTIONS
     -a   All the options.  The options: -v -c -b -p <tab>X are
	  implied.

     -b   Extract files into basenames so that files with abso-
	  lute path names are put into the current directory.
	  This option has strange effects when directories are
	  archived.

     -c   Check file size on extraction by counting characters.
	  An error message is reported to the person doing the
	  extraction if the sizes don't match.	One reason why
	  the sizes may not match is that _s_h_a_r will append a new-
	  line to complete incomplete last lines; _s_h_a_r prints a
	  message that mentions added newlines.  Another reason
	  why the sizes may not match is that some network mail
	  programs remove non-whitespace control characters.
	  _s_h_a_r prints a message that mentions control characters
	  to the extractor.

     -d   Use this as the ``end of file'' delimiter instead of
	  the default.	The only reason to change it is if you
	  suspect a file contains the default delimiter:
	  SHAR_EOF.

     -m   Reset the exact protection modes of files when they are
	  extracted (using the _c_h_m_o_d program).	By default, the
	  extractor's default file modes are used, and executable
	  files (e.g., shell scripts) are made executable.

     -p   Use this as the prefix to each line of the archived
	  files.  This is to make sure that special characters at
	  the start of lines are not eaten up by programs like
	  mailers.  If this option is used, the files will be

	  extracted with the stream editor sed rather than cat so
	  it is more efficient and portable to avoid setting the
	  prefix, though perhaps less safe if you don't know what
	  is in the files.

     -s   Silent running.  All checking and extra output is inhi-
	  bited.

     -u   Archive the input files with the _u_u_e_n_c_o_d_e format for
	  later extraction with _u_u_d_e_c_o_d_e. This will allow you to
	  send files with control characters in them, but will
	  slow down the extracting.  You must be sure that the
	  receiving party has access to uudecode.

     -v   Print verbose feedback messages about what _s_h_a_r is
	  doing to be printed during extraction.  Sizes of plain
	  files are echoed to allow a simple validity check.
