NAME
     split - split a file into pieces

SYNOPSIS
     split [ -_n ] [ file [ name ] ]

DESCRIPTION
     _S_p_l_i_t reads _f_i_l_e and writes it in _n-line pieces (default
     1000), as many as necessary, onto a set of output files.
     The name of the first output file is _n_a_m_e with aa appended,
     and so on lexicographically.  If no output name is given, x
     is default.

     If no input file is given, or if - is given in its stead,
     then the standard input file is used.
