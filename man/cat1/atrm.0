NAME
     atrm - remove jobs spooled by at

SYNOPSIS
     atrm [ -f ] [ -i ] [-] [[ job #] [ name ]... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _A_t_r_m removes jobs that were created with the _a_t(1) command.
     With the - flag, all jobs belonging to the person invoking
     _a_t_r_m are removed.	If a job number(s) is specified, _a_t_r_m
     attempts to remove only that job number(s).

     If the -f flag is used, all information regarding the remo-
     val of the specified jobs is suppressed.  If the -i flag is
     used, _a_t_r_m asks if a job should be removed; a response of
     'y' causes the job to be removed.

     If a user(s) name is specified, all jobs belonging to that
     user(s) are removed.  This form of invoking _a_t_r_m is useful
     only to the super-user.
