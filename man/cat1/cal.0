NAME
     cal - print calendar

SYNOPSIS
     cal [ month ] year

DESCRIPTION
     _C_a_l prints a calendar for the specified year.  If a month is
     also specified, a calendar just for that month is printed.
     _Y_e_a_r can be between 1 and 9999.  The _m_o_n_t_h is a number
     between 1 and 12.	The calendar produced is that for England
     and her colonies.

     Try September 1752.

BUGS
     The year is always considered to start in January even
     though this is historically naive.
     Beware that `cal 78' refers to the early Christian era, not
     the 20th century.
