NAME
     uname - display information about the system

SYNOPSIS
     uname [-amnrsv]

DESCRIPTION
     The uname command writes the name of the operating system
     implementation to standard output.  When options are speci-
     fied, strings representing one or more system characteris-
     tics are written to standard output.

     The options are as follows:

     -a        Behave as though the options -m, -n, -r , -s, and
	       -v were specified.

     -m        Write the type of the current hardware platform to
	       standard output.

     -n        Write the name of the system to standard output.

     -r        Write the current release level of the operating
	       system to standard output.

     -s        Write the name of the operating system implementa-
	       tion to standard output.

     -v        Write the version level of this release of the
	       operating system to standard output.

     If the -a flag is specified, or multiple flags are speci-
     fied, all output is written on a single line, separated by
     spaces.

     The uname utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
     occurs.

     (``POSIX'') specification.
