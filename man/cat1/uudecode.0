NAME
     uuencode, uudecode - encode/decode a binary file for
     transmission via mail

SYNOPSIS
     uuencode [ source ] remotedest | mail sys1!sys2!..!decode
     uudecode [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
     _U_u_e_n_c_o_d_e and _u_u_d_e_c_o_d_e are used to send a binary file via
     uucp (or other) mail.  This combination can be used over
     indirect mail links even when _u_u_s_e_n_d(1C) is not available.

     _U_u_e_n_c_o_d_e takes the named source file (default standard
     input) and produces an encoded version on the standard out-
     put.  The encoding uses only printing ASCII characters, and
     includes the mode of the file and the _r_e_m_o_t_e_d_e_s_t for recrea-
     tion on the remote system.

     _U_u_d_e_c_o_d_e reads an encoded file, strips off any leading and
     trailing lines added by mailers, and recreates the original
     file with the specified mode and name.

     The intent is that all mail to the user ``decode'' should be
     filtered through the _u_u_d_e_c_o_d_e program.  This way the file is
     created automatically without human intervention.	This is
     possible on the uucp network by either using _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l or by
     making _r_m_a_i_l be a link to _M_a_i_l instead of _m_a_i_l.  In each
     case, an alias must be created in a master file to get the
     automatic invocation of _u_u_d_e_c_o_d_e.

     If these facilities are not available, the file can be sent
     to a user on the remote machine who can uudecode it manu-
     ally.

     The encode file has an ordinary text form and can be edited
     by any text editor to change the mode or remote name.

BUGS
     The file is expanded by 35% (3 bytes become 4 plus control
     information) causing it to take longer to transmit.

     The user on the remote system who is invoking _u_u_d_e_c_o_d_e
     (often _u_u_c_p) must have write permission on the specified
     file.
