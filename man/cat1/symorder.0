NAME
     symorder - rearrange name list

SYNOPSIS
     symorder symlist file

DESCRIPTION
     The file _s_y_m_l_i_s_t contains a list of symbols to be found in
     _f_i_l_e, one symbol per line.

     The symbol table of _f_i_l_e is updated in place; symbols read
     from _s_y_m_l_i_s_t are relocated to the beginning of the table and
     in the order given.

     This program was specifically designed to cut down on the
     overhead of getting symbols from the kernel name list.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The _s_y_m_o_r_d_e_r(1) utility exits 0 on success, non zero if an
     error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     nm(1), nlist(3), strip(1)

HISTORY
     The symorder command appeared in 3.0BSD.
