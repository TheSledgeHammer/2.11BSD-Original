NAME
     vwidth - make troff width table for a font

SYNOPSIS
     vwidth fontfile pointsize > ft_x_x.c
     cc -c ft_x_x.c mv ft_x_x.o /usr/share/font/ft_x_x

DESCRIPTION
     _V_w_i_d_t_h translates from the width information stored in the
     vfont style format to the format expected by troff.  Troff
     wants an object file in a.out(5) format.  (This fact does
     not seem to be documented anywhere.) Troff should look
     directly in the font file but it doesn't.

     Vwidth should be used after editing a font with _f_e_d(_1). It
     is not necessary to use vwidth unless you have made a change
     that would affect the width tables.  Such changes include
     numerically editing the width field, adding a new character,
     and moving or copying a character to a new position.  It is
     _n_o_t always necessary to use vwidth if the physical width of
     the glyph (e.g. the number of columns in the bit matrix) has
     changed, but if it has changed much the logical width should
     probably be changed and vwidth run.

     Vwidth produces a C program on its standard output.  This
     program should be run through the C compiler and the object
     (that is, the .o file) saved.  The resulting file should be
     placed in /usr/share/font in the file ft_x_x where is a one or
     two letter code that is the logical (internal to troff) font
     name.  This name can be found by looking in the file
     /usr/share/fontinfo/_f_n_a_m_e* where _f_n_a_m_e is the external name
     of the font.

BUGS
     Produces the C file using obsolete syntax that the portable
     C compiler complains about.
