NAME
     groups - show group memberships

SYNOPSIS
     groups [_u_s_e_r]

DESCRIPTION
     The groups utility has been obsoleted by the id(1) utility,
     and is equivalent to ``id -Gn [_u_s_e_r]''.  The command
     ``id -p'' is suggested for normal interactive use.

     The groups utility displays the groups to which you (or the
     optionally specified user) belong.

     The groups utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
     occurs.
