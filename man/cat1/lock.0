LOCK(1)             UNIX Programmer's Manual		  LOCK(1)



NAME
     lock - reserve a terminal

SYNOPSIS
     lock [ -p ] [ -t timeout ]

DESCRIPTION
     _L_o_c_k requests a password from the user, reads it again for
     verification and then will normally not relinquish the ter-
     minal until the password is repeated.  There are two other
     conditions under which it will terminate: it will timeout
     after some interval of time and it may be killed by someone
     with the appropriate permission.  The default time limit is
     15 minutes, which may be changed with the -_t option where
     _t_i_m_e_o_u_t is the time limit in minutes.  The -_p option causes
     _l_o_c_k to use the user's current password instead of request-
     ing another one.
