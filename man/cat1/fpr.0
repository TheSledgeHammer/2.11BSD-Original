NAME
     fpr - print Fortran file

SYNOPSIS
     fpr

DESCRIPTION
     _F_p_r is a filter that transforms files formatted according to
     Fortran's carriage control conventions into files formatted
     according to UNIX line printer conventions.

     _F_p_r copies its input onto its output, replacing the carriage
     control characters with characters that will produce the
     intended effects when printed using _l_p_r(1).  The first char-
     acter of each line determines the vertical spacing as fol-
     lows:

	 +---------------+--------------------------------+
	 |   Character	 | Vertical Space Before Printing |
	 |---------------+--------------------------------|
	 |     Blank	 | One line			  |
	 |	 0	 | Two lines			  |
	 |	 1	 | To first line of next page	  |
	 |	 +	 | No advance			  |
	 +---------------+--------------------------------+


     A blank line is treated as if its first character is a
     blank. A blank that appears as a carriage control character
     is deleted. A zero is changed to a newline.  A one is
     changed to a form feed. The effects of a "+" are simulated
     using backspaces.

EXAMPLES
     a.out | fpr | lpr

     fpr < f77.output | lpr

BUGS
     Results are undefined for input lines longer than 170 char-
     acters.
