APROPOS(1)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       APROPOS(1)



NAME
     apropos - locate commands by keyword lookup

SYNOPSIS
     apropos keyword ...

DESCRIPTION
     _A_p_r_o_p_o_s shows which manual sections contain instances of any
     of the given keywords in their title.  Each word is con-
     sidered separately and case of letters is ignored.  Words
     which are part of other words are considered; thus, when
     looking for compile, _a_p_r_o_p_o_s will find all instances of
     `compiler' also.  Try

	  apropos password

     and

	  apropos editor

     If the line starts `name(section) ...' you can do `man sec-
     tion name' to get the documentation for it.  Try `apropos
     format' and then `man 3s printf' to get the manual on the
     subroutine _p_r_i_n_t_f.

     _A_p_r_o_p_o_s is actually just the -k option to the _m_a_n(1) com-
     mand.
