NAME
     script - make typescript of terminal session

SYNOPSIS
     script [ -a ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
     _S_c_r_i_p_t makes a typescript of everything printed on your ter-
     minal.  The typescript is written to _f_i_l_e, or appended to
     _f_i_l_e if the -a option is given.  It can be sent to the line
     printer later with _l_p_r.  If no file name is given, the
     typescript is saved in the file _t_y_p_e_s_c_r_i_p_t.

     The script ends when the forked shell exits.

     This program is useful when using a crt and a hard-copy
     record of the dialog is desired, as for a student handing in
     a program that was developed on a crt when hard-copy termi-
     nals are in short supply.

BUGS
     _S_c_r_i_p_t places everything in the log file.	This is not what
     the naive user expects.
