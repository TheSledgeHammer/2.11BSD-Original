NAME
     tee - pipe fitting

SYNOPSIS
     tee [ -i ] [ -a ] [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _T_e_e transcribes the standard input to the standard output
     and makes copies in the _f_i_l_e_s. Option -i ignores interrupts;
     option -a causes the output to be appended to the _f_i_l_e_s
     rather than overwriting them.
