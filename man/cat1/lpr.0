NAME
     lpr - off line print

SYNOPSIS
     lpr [ -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r ] [ -#_n_u_m ] [ -C _c_l_a_s_s ] [ -J _j_o_b ] [ -T
     _t_i_t_l_e ] [ -i [ _n_u_m_c_o_l_s ]] [ -1234 _f_o_n_t ] [ -w_n_u_m ] [
     -pltndgvcfrmhs ] [ name ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
     Lpr uses a spooling daemon to print the named files when
     facilities become available.  If no names appear, the stan-
     dard input is assumed.  The -P option may be used to force
     output to a specific printer.  Normally, the default printer
     is used (site dependent), or the value of the environment
     variable PRINTER is used.

     The following single letter options are used to notify the
     line printer spooler that the files are not standard text
     files. The spooling daemon will use the appropriate filters
     to print the data accordingly.

     -p   Use _p_r(1) to format the files (equivalent to _p_r_i_n_t).

     -l   Use a filter which allows control characters to be
	  printed and suppresses page breaks.

     -t   The files are assumed to contain data from _t_r_o_f_f(1)
	  (cat phototypesetter commands).

     -n   The files are assumed to contain data from _d_i_t_r_o_f_f
	  (device independent troff).

     -d   The files are assumed to contain data from _t_e_x(l) (DVI
	  format from Stanford).

     -g   The files are assumed to contain standard plot data as
	  produced by the _p_l_o_t(3X) routines (see also _p_l_o_t(1G)
	  for the filters used by the printer spooler).

     -v   The files are assumed to contain a raster image for
	  devices like the Benson Varian.

     -c   The files are assumed to contain data produced by
	  _c_i_f_p_l_o_t(l).

     -f   Use a filter which interprets the first character of
	  each line as a standard FORTRAN carriage control char-
	  acter.

     The remaining single letter options have the following mean-
     ing.

     -r   Remove the file upon completion of spooling or upon
	  completion of printing (with the -s option).

     -m   Send mail upon completion.

     -h   Suppress the printing of the burst page.

     -s   Use symbolic links.  Usually files are copied to the
	  spool directory.

     The -C option takes the following argument as a job classif-
     ication for use on the burst page.  For example,

	  lpr -C EECS foo.c

     causes the system name (the name returned by _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e(1)) to
     be replaced on the burst page by EECS, and the file foo.c to
     be printed.

     The -J option takes the following argument as the job name
     to print on the burst page.  Normally, the first file's name
     is used.

     The -T option uses the next argument as the title used by
     _p_r(1) instead of the file name.

     To get multiple copies of output, use the -#_n_u_m option,
     where _n_u_m is the number of copies desired of each file
     named.  For example,

	  lpr -#3 foo.c bar.c more.c

     would result in 3 copies of the file foo.c, followed by 3
     copies of the file bar.c, etc.  On the other hand,

	  cat foo.c bar.c more.c | lpr -#3

     will give three copies of the concatenation of the files.

     The -i option causes the output to be indented. If the next
     argument is numeric, it is used as the number of blanks to
     be printed before each line; otherwise, 8 characters are
     printed.

     The -w option takes the immediately following number to be
     the page width for _p_r.

     The -s option will use _s_y_m_l_i_n_k(2) to link data files rather
     than trying to copy them so large files can be printed.
     This means the files should not be modified or removed until
     they have been printed.

     The option -1234 Specifies a font to be mounted on font
     position _i.  The daemon will construct a ._r_a_i_l_m_a_g file
     referencing /_u_s_r/_s_h_a_r_e/_v_f_o_n_t/_n_a_m_e._s_i_z_e.

FILES
     /etc/passwd	    personal identification
     /etc/printcap	    printer capabilities data base
     /usr/sbin/lpd	    line printer daemon
     /usr/spool/*	    directories used for spooling
     /usr/spool/*/cf*	    daemon control files
     /usr/spool/*/df*	    data files specified in "cf" files
     /usr/spool/*/tf*	    temporary copies of "cf" files

     lpd(8)

DIAGNOSTICS
     If you try to spool too large a file, it will be truncated.
     _L_p_r will object to printing binary files.	If a user other
     than root prints a file and spooling is disabled, _l_p_r will
     print a message saying so and will not put jobs in the
     queue.  If a connection to _l_p_d on the local machine cannot
     be made, _l_p_r will say that the daemon cannot be started.
     Diagnostics may be printed in the daemon's log file regard-
     ing missing spool files by _l_p_d.

BUGS
     Fonts for _t_r_o_f_f and _t_e_x reside on the host with the printer.
     It is currently not possible to use local font libraries.
