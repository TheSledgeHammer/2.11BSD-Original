NAME
     roffbib - run off bibliographic database

SYNOPSIS
     roffbib [ -e ] [ -h ] [ -n ] [ -o ] [ -r ] [ -s ] [ -T_t_e_r_m ]
     [ -x ] [ -m _m_a_c ] [ -V ] [ -Q ] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _R_o_f_f_b_i_b prints out all records in a bibliographic database,
     in bibliography format rather than as footnotes or endnotes.
     Generally it is used in conjunction with _s_o_r_t_b_i_b:

	  sortbib  database | roffbib

     _R_o_f_f_b_i_b accepts most of the options understood by _n_r_o_f_f(1),
     most importantly the -T flag to specify terminal type.

     If abstracts or comments are entered following the %X field
     key, _r_o_f_f_b_i_b will format them into paragraphs for an anno-
     tated bibliography.  Several %X fields may be given if
     several annotation paragraphs are desired.  The -x flag will
     suppress the printing of these abstracts.

     A user-defined set of macros may be specified after the -m
     option.  There should be a space between the -m and the
     macro filename.  This set of macros will replace the ones
     defined in /usr/share/tmac/tmac.bib.  The -V flag will send
     output to the Versatec; the -Q flag will queue output for
     the phototypesetter.

     Four command-line registers control formatting style of the
     bibliography, much like the number registers of _m_s(7).  The
     command-line argument -rN1 will number the references start-
     ing at one (1).  The flag -rV2 will double space the biblio-
     graphy, while -rV1 will double space references but single
     space annotation paragraphs.  The line length can be changed
     from the default 6.5 inches to 6 inches with the -rL6i argu-
     ment, and the page offset can be set from the default of 0
     to one inch by specifying -rO1i (capital O, not zero).
     Note: with the -V and -Q flags the default page offset is
     already one inch.

BUGS
     Users have to rewrite macros to create customized formats.
