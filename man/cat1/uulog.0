NAME
     uulog - display UUCP log files

SYNOPSIS
     uulog [ -s _s_y_s ] [ -u _u_s_e_r ]

DESCRIPTION
     _U_u_l_o_g queries a log of _u_u_c_p(1C) and _u_u_x(1C) transactions in
     the file /usr/spool/uucp/LOGFILE.

     The options command _u_u_l_o_g to print logging information:

     -s_s_y_s   Print information about work involving system _s_y_s.

     -u_u_s_e_r  Print information about work done for the specified
	     _u_s_e_r.

FILES
     /usr/spool/uucp/LOGFILE

SEE ALSO
     uucp(1C), uux(1C).

NOTES
     Very early releases of UUCP used separate log files for each
     of the UUCP utilities; _u_u_l_o_g was used to merge the indivi-
     dual logs into a master file.  This capability has not been
     necessary for some time and is no longer supported.

BUGS
     UUCP's recording of which user issued a request is unreli-
     able.

     _U_u_l_o_g is little more than an overspecialized version of
     _g_r_e_p(1).
