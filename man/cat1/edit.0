NAME
     ex, edit - text editor

SYNOPSIS
     ex [ - ] [ -v ] [ -t tag ] [ -r ] [ +_c_o_m_m_a_n_d ] [ -l ] name
     ...
     edit [ ex options ]

DESCRIPTION
     _E_x is the root of a family of editors: _e_d_i_t, _e_x and _v_i. _E_x
     is a superset of _e_d, with the most notable extension being a
     display editing facility.	Display based editing is the
     focus of _v_i.

     If you have not used _e_d, or are a casual user, you will find
     that the editor _e_d_i_t is convenient for you.  It avoids some
     of the complexities of _e_x used mostly by systems programmers
     and persons very familiar with _e_d.

     If you have a CRT terminal, you may wish to use a display
     based editor; in this case see _v_i(1), which is a command
     which focuses on the display editing portion of _e_x.

DOCUMENTATION
     The document _E_d_i_t: _A _t_u_t_o_r_i_a_l (USD:14) provides a comprehen-
     sive introduction to _e_d_i_t assuming no previous knowledge of
     computers or the UNIX system.

     The _E_x _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _M_a_n_u_a_l - _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _3._7 (USD:16) is a
     comprehensive and complete manual for the command mode
     features of _e_x, but you cannot learn to use the editor by
     reading it.  For an introduction to more advanced forms of
     editing using the command mode of _e_x see the editing docu-
     ments written by Brian Kernighan for the editor _e_d; the
     material in the introductory and advanced documents works
     also with _e_x.

     _A_n _I_n_t_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n _t_o _D_i_s_p_l_a_y _E_d_i_t_i_n_g _w_i_t_h _V_i (USD:15) intro-
     duces the display editor _v_i and provides reference material
     on _v_i. In addition, the _V_i _Q_u_i_c_k _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e card summarizes
     the commands of _v_i in a useful, functional way, and is use-
     ful with the _I_n_t_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n.

AUTHOR
     Originally written by William Joy
     Mark Horton has maintained the editor since version 2.7,
     adding macros, support for many unusual terminals, and other
     features such as word abbreviation mode.

BUGS
     The _u_n_d_o command causes all marks to be lost on lines
     changed and then restored if the marked lines were changed.

     _U_n_d_o never clears the buffer modified condition.

     The _z command prints a number of logical rather than physi-
     cal lines.  More than a screen full of output may result if
     long lines are present.

     File input/output errors don't print a name if the command
     line `-' option is used.

     There is no easy way to do a single scan ignoring case.

     The editor does not warn if text is placed in named buffers
     and not used before exiting the editor.

     Null characters are discarded in input files, and cannot
     appear in resultant files.
