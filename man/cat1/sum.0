NAME
     sum - sum and count blocks in a file

SYNOPSIS
     sum file

DESCRIPTION
     _S_u_m calculates and prints a 16-bit checksum for the named
     file, and also prints the number of blocks in the file.  It
     is typically used to look for bad spots, or to validate a
     file communicated over some transmission line.

SEE ALSO
     wc(1)

DIAGNOSTICS
     `Read error' is indistinguishable from end of file on most
     devices; check the block count.
