VACATION(1)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	      VACATION(1)



NAME
     vacation - return ``I am on vacation'' indication

SYNOPSIS
     vacation -I
     vacation user

DESCRIPTION
     _V_a_c_a_t_i_o_n returns a message to the sender of a message tel-
     ling that you are on vacation.  The intended use is in a
     ._f_o_r_w_a_r_d file.  For example, your ._f_o_r_w_a_r_d file might have:

	  \eric, "|vacation eric"

     which would send messages to you (assuming your login name
     was eric) and send a message back to the sender.

     _V_a_c_a_t_i_o_n expects a file ._v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n._m_s_g in your home directory
     containing a message to be sent back to each sender.  It
     should be an entire message (including headers).  For exam-
     ple, it might say:

	  From: eric@ucbmonet.Berkeley.EDU (Eric Allman)
	  Subject: I am on vacation
	  Delivered-By-The-Graces-Of: the Vacation program

	  I am on vacation until July 22.  If you have something urgent,
	  please contact Joe Kalash <kalash@ucbingres.Berkeley.EDU>.
	       --eric

     This message will only be sent once a week to each unique
     sender.  The people who have sent you messages are kept in
     the files ._v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n._p_a_g and ._v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n._d_i_r in your home
     directory.  The -I option initializes these files, and
     should be executed before you modify your ._f_o_r_w_a_r_d file.

     If the -I flag is not specified, _v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n reads the first
     line from the standard input for a UNIX-style ``From'' line
     to determine the sender.  If this is not present, a nasty
     diagnostic is produced.  _S_e_n_d_m_a_i_l(8) includes the ``From''
     line automatically.

     No message is sent if the initial ``From'' line includes the
     string ``-REQUEST@'' or if a ``Precedence: bulk'' or ``Pre-
     cedence: junk'' line is included in the header.
