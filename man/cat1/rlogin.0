NAME
     rlogin - remote login

SYNOPSIS
     rlogin rhost [ -e_c ] [ -8 ] [ -L ] [ -l username ]
     rhost [ -e_c ] [ -8 ] [ -L ] [ -l username ]

DESCRIPTION
     _R_l_o_g_i_n connects your terminal on the current local host sys-
     tem _l_h_o_s_t to the remote host system _r_h_o_s_t.

     Each host has a file /_e_t_c/_h_o_s_t_s._e_q_u_i_v which contains a list
     of _r_h_o_s_t's with which it shares account names.  (The host
     names must be the standard names as described in _r_s_h(1C).)
     When you _r_l_o_g_i_n as the same user on an equivalent host, you
     don't need to give a password.  Each user may also have a
     private equivalence list in a file .rhosts in his login
     directory.  Each line in this file should contain an _r_h_o_s_t
     and a _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e separated by a space, giving additional cases
     where logins without passwords are to be permitted.  If the
     originating user is not equivalent to the remote user, then
     a login and password will be prompted for on the remote
     machine as in _l_o_g_i_n(1).  To avoid some security problems,
     the .rhosts file must be owned by either the remote user or
     root.

     The remote terminal type is the same as your local terminal
     type (as given in your environment TERM variable).  The ter-
     minal or window size is also copied to the remote system if
     the server supports the option, and changes in size are
     reflected as well.  All echoing takes place at the remote
     site, so that (except for delays) the rlogin is transparent.
     Flow control via ^S and ^Q and flushing of input and output
     on interrupts are handled properly.  The optional argument
     -8 allows an eight-bit input data path at all times; other-
     wise parity bits are stripped except when the remote side's
     stop and start characters are other than ^S/^Q.  The argu-
     ment -L allows the rlogin session to be run in litout mode.
     A line of the form ``~.'' disconnects from the remote host,
     where ``~'' is the escape character.  Similarly, the line
     ``~^Z'' (where ^Z, control-Z, is the suspend character) will
     suspend the rlogin session.  Substitution of the delayed-
     suspend character (normally ^Y) for the suspend character
     suspends the send portion of the rlogin, but allows output
     from the remote system.  A different escape character may be
     specified by the -e option.  There is no space separating
     this option flag and the argument character.
