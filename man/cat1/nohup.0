NAME
     nice, nohup - run a command at low priority (_s_h only)

SYNOPSIS
     nice [ -_n_u_m_b_e_r ] command [ arguments ]

     nohup command [ arguments ]

DESCRIPTION
     _N_i_c_e executes _c_o_m_m_a_n_d with low scheduling priority.  If the
     _n_u_m_b_e_r argument is present, the priority is incremented
     (higher numbers mean lower priorities) by that amount up to
     a limit of 20.  The default _n_u_m_b_e_r is 10.

     The super-user may run commands with priority higher than
     normal by using a negative priority, e.g. `--10'.

     _N_o_h_u_p executes _c_o_m_m_a_n_d immune to hangup and terminate sig-
     nals from the controlling terminal.  The priority is incre-
     mented by 5.  _N_o_h_u_p should be invoked from the shell with
     `&' in order to prevent it from responding to interrupts by
     or stealing the input from the next person who logs in on
     the same terminal.

FILES
     nohup.out standard output and standard error file under
     _n_o_h_u_p

SEE ALSO
     csh(1), setpriority(2), renice(8)

DIAGNOSTICS
     _N_i_c_e returns the exit status of the subject command.

BUGS
     _N_i_c_e and _n_o_h_u_p are particular to _s_h(1).  If you use _c_s_h(1),
     then commands executed with ``&'' are automatically immune
     to hangup signals while in the background.  There is a buil-
     tin command _n_o_h_u_p which provides immunity from terminate,
     but it does not redirect output to _n_o_h_u_p._o_u_t.

     _N_i_c_e is built into _c_s_h(1) with a slightly different syntax
     than described here.  The form ``nice +10'' nices to posi-
     tive nice, and ``nice -10'' can be used by the super-user to
     give a process more of the processor.
