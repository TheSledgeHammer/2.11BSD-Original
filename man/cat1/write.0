NAME
     write - write to another user

SYNOPSIS
     write user [ ttyname ]

DESCRIPTION
     _W_r_i_t_e copies lines from your terminal to that of another
     user.  When first called, it sends the message

	  Message from yourname@yoursystem on yourttyname at
     time...

     The recipient of the message should write back at this
     point.  Communication continues until an end of file is read
     from the terminal or an interrupt is sent.  At that point
     _w_r_i_t_e writes `EOT' on the other terminal and exits.

     If you want to write to a user who is logged in more than
     once, the _t_t_y_n_a_m_e argument may be used to indicate the
     appropriate terminal name.

     Permission to write may be denied or granted by use of the
     _m_e_s_g command.  At the outset writing is allowed.  Certain
     commands, in particular _n_r_o_f_f and _p_r(1) disallow messages in
     order to prevent messy output.

     If the character `!' is found at the beginning of a line,
     _w_r_i_t_e calls the shell to execute the rest of the line as a
     command.

     The following protocol is suggested for using _w_r_i_t_e: when
     you first write to another user, wait for him to write back
     before starting to send.  Each party should end each message
     with a distinctive signal-(o) for `over' is conventional-
     that the other may reply.	(oo) for `over and out' is sug-
     gested when conversation is about to be terminated.

FILES
     /var/run/utmp  to find user
     /bin/sh	    to execute `!'
