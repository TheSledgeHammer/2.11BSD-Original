NAME
     uniq - report repeated lines in a file

SYNOPSIS
     uniq [ -udc [ +n ] [ -n ] ] [ input [ output ] ]

DESCRIPTION
     _U_n_i_q reads the input file comparing adjacent lines.  In the
     normal case, the second and succeeding copies of repeated
     lines are removed; the remainder is written on the output
     file.  Note that repeated lines must be adjacent in order to
     be found; see _s_o_r_t(1).  If the -u flag is used, just the
     lines that are not repeated in the original file are output.
     The -d option specifies that one copy of just the repeated
     lines is to be written.  The normal mode output is the union
     of the -u and -d mode outputs.

     The -c option supersedes -u and -d and generates an output
     report in default style but with each line preceded by a
     count of the number of times it occurred.

     The _n arguments specify skipping an initial portion of each
     line in the comparison:

     -_n      The first _n fields together with any blanks before
	     each are ignored.	A field is defined as a string of
	     non-space, non-tab characters separated by tabs and
	     spaces from its neighbors.

     +_n      The first _n characters are ignored.  Fields are
	     skipped before characters.
