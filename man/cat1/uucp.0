NAME
     uucp - unix to unix copy

SYNOPSIS
     uucp [ -acCdfmr ] [ -n_u_s_e_r ] [ -g_g_r_a_d_e ] [ -s_s_p_o_o_l ] [ -x_d_e_-
     _b_u_g ] source-file....  destination-file

DESCRIPTION
     _U_u_c_p copies files named by the source-file arguments to the
     destination-file argument.  A file name may be a pathname on
     your machine, or may have the form

	  system-name!pathname

     where `system-name' is taken from a list of system names
     that _u_u_c_p knows about.  Shell metacharacters ?*[] appearing
     in the pathname part will be expanded on the appropriate
     system.

     Pathnames may be one of:

     (1)  a full pathname;

     (2)  a pathname preceded by ~_u_s_e_r; where _u_s_e_r is a userid on
	  the specified system and is replaced by that user's
	  login directory;

     (3)  a pathname prefixed by ~, where ~ is expanded into the
	  system's public directory (usually
	  /usr/spool/uucppublic);

     (4)  a partial pathname, which is prefixed by the current
	  directory.

     If the result is an erroneous pathname for the remote sys-
     tem, the copy will fail.  If the destination-file is a
     directory, the last part of the source-file name is used.

     _U_u_c_p preserves execute permissions across the transmission
     and gives 0666 read and write permissions (see _c_h_m_o_d(2)).

     The following options are interpreted by _u_u_c_p.

     -a   Avoid doing a _g_e_t_w_d to find the current directory.
	  (This is sometimes used for efficiency.)

     -c   Use the source file when copying out rather than copy-
	  ing the file to the spool directory.	(This is the
	  default.)

     -C   Copy the source file to the spool directory and
	  transmit the copy.

     -d   Make all necessary directories for the file copy.
	  (This is the default.)

     -f   Do not make intermediate directories for the file copy.

     -g_g_r_a_d_e
	  _G_r_a_d_e is a single letter/number; lower ASCII sequence
	  characters will cause a job to be transmitted earlier
	  during a particular conversation.  Default is `n'. By
	  way of comparison, _u_u_x(1C) defaults to `A'; mail is
	  usually sent at `C'.

     -m   Send mail to the requester when the copy is complete.

     -n_u_s_e_r
	  Notify _u_s_e_r on remote system (i.e., send _u_s_e_r mail)
	  that a file was sent.

     -r   Do not start the transfer, just queue the job.

     -s_s_p_o_o_l
	  Use _s_p_o_o_l as the spool directory instead of the
	  default.

     -x_d_e_b_u_g
	  Turn on the debugging at level _d_e_b_u_g.

FILES
     /usr/spool/uucp - spool directory
     /etc/uucp/* - data and configuration files

WARNING
     The domain of remotely accessible files can (and for obvious
     security reasons, usually should) be severely restricted.
     You will very likely not be able to fetch files by pathname;
     ask a responsible person on the remote system to send them
     to you.  For the same reasons you will probably not be able
     to send files to arbitrary pathnames.

BUGS
     All files received by _u_u_c_p will be owned by the uucp
     administrator (usually UID 5).

     The -m option will only work sending files or receiving a
     single file.  (Receiving multiple files specified by special
     shell characters ?*[] will not activate the -m option.)

     At present _u_u_c_p cannot copy to a system several "hops" away,
     that is, a command of the form

	  uucp myfile system1!system2!system3!yourfile

     is not permitted. Use _u_u_s_e_n_d(1C) instead.

     When invoking _u_u_c_p from _c_s_h(1), the `!' character must be
     prefixed by the `\' escape to inhibit _c_s_h's history mechan-
     ism. (Quotes are not sufficient.)

     _U_u_c_p refuses to copy a file that does not give read access
     to ``other''; that is, the file must have at least 0444
     modes.
