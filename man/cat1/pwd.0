PWD(1)		    UNIX Programmer's Manual		   PWD(1)



NAME
     pwd - working directory name

SYNOPSIS
     pwd

DESCRIPTION
     _P_w_d prints the pathname of the working (current) directory.

SEE ALSO
     cd(1), csh(1), getwd(3)

BUGS
     In _c_s_h(1) the command _d_i_r_s is always faster (although it can
     give a different answer in the rare case that the current
     directory or a containing directory was moved after the
     shell descended into it).
