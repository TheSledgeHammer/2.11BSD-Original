NAME
     atq - print the queue of jobs waiting to be run

SYNOPSIS
     atq [ -c ] [ -n ] [ name ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _A_t_q prints the queue of jobs that are waiting to be run at a
     later date. These jobs were created with the _a_t(1) command.
     With no flags, the queue is sorted in the order that the
     jobs will be executed.

     If the -c flag is used, the queue is sorted by the time that
     the _a_t command was given.

     The -n flag prints only the total number of files that are
     currently in the queue.

     If a name(s) is provided, only those files belonging to that
     user(s) are displayed.

FILES
     /usr/spool/at	 spool area
