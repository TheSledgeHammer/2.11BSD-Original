SYNOPSIS
     file file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _F_i_l_e performs a series of tests on each argument in an
     attempt to classify it.  If an argument appears to be ascii,
     _f_i_l_e examines the first 512 bytes and tries to guess its
     language.

BUGS
     It often makes mistakes.  In particular it often suggests
     that command files are C programs.

     Does not recognize Pascal or LISP.
