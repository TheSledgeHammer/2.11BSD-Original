NAME
     chgrp - change group

SYNOPSIS
     chgrp [ -f -R ] group file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _C_h_g_r_p changes the group-ID of the _f_i_l_e_s to _g_r_o_u_p.	The group
     may be either a decimal GID or a group name found in the
     group-ID file.

     The user invoking _c_h_g_r_p must belong to the specified group
     and be the owner of the file, or be the super-user.

     No errors are reported when the -f (force) option is given.

     When the -R option is given, _c_h_g_r_p recursively descends its
     directory arguments setting the specified group-ID.  When
     symbolic links are encountered, their group is changed, but
     they are not traversed.

FILES
     /etc/group

SEE ALSO
     chown(2), passwd(5), group(5)
