NAME
     tabs - set terminal tabs

SYNOPSIS
     tabs [ -n ] [ terminal ]

DESCRIPTION
     _T_a_b_s sets the tabs on a variety of terminals.  Various ter-
     minal names given in _t_e_r_m(7) are recognized; the default is,
     however, suitable for most 300 baud terminals.  If the -n
     flag is present then the left margin is not indented as is
     normal.

BUGS
     It's much better to use _t_s_e_t(1).
