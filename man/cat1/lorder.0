NAME
     lorder - find ordering relation for an object library

SYNOPSIS
     lorder file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The input is one or more object or library archive (see
     _a_r(1)) _f_i_l_e_s. The standard output is a list of pairs of
     object file names, meaning that the first file of the pair
     refers to external identifiers defined in the second.  The
     output may be processed by _t_s_o_r_t(1) to find an ordering of a
     library suitable for one-pass access by _l_d(1).

     This brash one-liner intends to build a new library from
     existing `.o' files.

	  ar cr library `lorder *.o | tsort`

     The need for lorder may be vitiated by use of _r_a_n_l_i_b(1),
     which converts an ordered archive into a randomly accessed
     library.

FILES
     *symref, *symdef
     nm(1), sed(1), sort(1), join(1)

SEE ALSO
     tsort(1), ld(1), ar(1), ranlib(1)

BUGS
     The names of object files, in and out of libraries, must end
     with `.o'; nonsense results otherwise.
