NAME
     pxp - Pascal execution profiler

SYNOPSIS
     pxp [ -acdefjnstuw_ ] [ -23456789 ] [ -z [ name ... ] ]
     name.p

DESCRIPTION
     _P_x_p can be used to obtain execution profiles of Pascal pro-
     grams or as a pretty-printer.  To produce an execution pro-
     file all that is necessary is to translate the program
     specifying the z option to _p_i or _p_i_x, to execute the pro-
     gram, and to then issue the command

	  pxp -z name.p

     A reformatted listing is output if none of the c, t, or z
     options are specified; thus

	  pxp old.p > new.p

     places a pretty-printed version of the program in `old.p' in
     the file `new.p'.

     The use of the following options of _p_x_p is discussed in sec-
     tions 2.6, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.10 of the _B_e_r_k_e_l_e_y _P_a_s_c_a_l _U_s_e_r'_s
     _M_a_n_u_a_l.

     -a    Print the bodies of all procedures and functions in
	   the profile; even those which were never executed.

     -c    Extract profile data from the file _c_o_r_e.

     -d    Include declaration parts in a profile.

     -e    Eliminate include directives when reformatting a file;
	   the include is replaced by the reformatted contents of
	   the specified file.

     -f    Fully parenthesize expressions.

     -j    Left justify all procedures and functions.

     -n    Eject a new page as each file is included; in pro-
	   files, print a blank line at the top of the page.

     -s    Strip comments from the input text.

     -t    Print a table summarizing procedure and function call
	   counts.

     -u    Card image mode; only the first 72 characters of input

	   lines are used.

     -w    Suppress warning diagnostics.

     -z    Generate an execution profile.  If no _n_a_m_es, are given
	   the profile is of the entire program.  If a list of
	   names is given, then only any specified procedures or
	   functions and the contents of any specified include
	   files will appear in the profile.

     -_    Underline keywords.

     -_d    With _d a digit, 2 <_ _d <_ 9, causes _p_x_p to use _d spaces
	   as the basic indenting unit.  The default is 4.

DIAGNOSTICS
     For a basic explanation do

	     pxp

     Error diagnostics include `No profile data in file' with the
     c option if the z option was not enabled to _p_i; `Not a Pas-
     cal system core file' if the core is not from a _p_x execu-
     tion; `Program and count data do not correspond' if the pro-
     gram was changed after compilation, before profiling; or if
     the wrong program is specified.
