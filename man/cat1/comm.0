COMM(1)             UNIX Programmer's Manual		  COMM(1)



NAME
     comm - select or reject lines common to two sorted files

SYNOPSIS
     comm [ - [ 123 ] ] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
     _C_o_m_m reads _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2, which should be ordered in ASCII
     collating sequence, and produces a three column output:
     lines only in _f_i_l_e_1; lines only in _f_i_l_e_2; and lines in both
     files.  The filename `-' means the standard input.

     Flags 1, 2, or 3 suppress printing of the corresponding
     column.  Thus comm -12 prints only the lines common to the
     two files; comm -23 prints only lines in the first file but
     not in the second; comm -123 is a no-op.
