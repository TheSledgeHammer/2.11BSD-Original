NAME
     vi - screen oriented (visual) display editor based on ex

SYNOPSIS
     vi [ -t tag ] [ -r ] [ +_c_o_m_m_a_n_d ] [ -l ] [ -w_n ] name ...

DESCRIPTION
     _V_i (visual) is a display oriented text editor based on
     _e_x(1).  _E_x and _v_i run the same code; it is possible to get
     to the command mode of _e_x from within _v_i and vice-versa.

     The _V_i _Q_u_i_c_k _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e card and the _I_n_t_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n _t_o _D_i_s_p_l_a_y
     _E_d_i_t_i_n_g _w_i_t_h _V_i provide full details on using _v_i.

     version 3

BUGS
     Software tabs using ^T work only immediately after the
     _a_u_t_o_i_n_d_e_n_t.

     Left and right shifts on intelligent terminals don't make
     use of insert and delete character operations in the termi-
     nal.

     The _w_r_a_p_m_a_r_g_i_n option can be fooled since it looks at output
     columns when blanks are typed.  If a long word passes
     through the margin and onto the next line without a break,
     then the line won't be broken.

     Insert/delete within a line can be slow if tabs are present
     on intelligent terminals, since the terminals need help in
     doing this correctly.

     Saving text on deletes in the named buffers is somewhat
     inefficient.

     The _s_o_u_r_c_e command does not work when executed as :source;
     there is no way to use the :append, :change, and :insert
     commands, since it is not possible to give more than one
     line of input to a : escape.  To use these on a :global you
     must Q to _e_x command mode, execute them, and then reenter
     the screen editor with _v_i or _o_p_e_n.
