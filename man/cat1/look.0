NAME
     look - find lines in a sorted list

SYNOPSIS
     look [ -df ] string [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
     _L_o_o_k consults a sorted _f_i_l_e and prints all lines that begin
     with _s_t_r_i_n_g.  It uses binary search.

     The options d and f affect comparisons as in _s_o_r_t(1):

     d	 `Dictionary' order: only letters, digits, tabs and
	 blanks participate in comparisons.

     f	 Fold.	Upper case letters compare equal to lower case.

     If no _f_i_l_e is specified, /_u_s_r/_d_i_c_t/_w_o_r_d_s is assumed with
     collating sequence -df.

FILES
