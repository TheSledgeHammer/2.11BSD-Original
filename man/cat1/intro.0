NAME
     intro - introduction to commands

DESCRIPTION
     This section describes publicly accessible commands in
     alphabetic order.	Certain distinctions of purpose are made
     in the headings:

     (1)  Commands of general utility.

     (1C) Commands for communication with other systems.

     (1G) Commands used primarily for graphics and computer-aided
	  design.

     N.B.: Commands related to system maintenance used to appear
     in section 1 manual pages and were distinguished by (1M) at
     the top of the page.  These manual pages now appear in sec-
     tion 8.

SEE ALSO
     Section (6) for computer games.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Upon termination each command returns two bytes of status,
     one supplied by the system giving the cause for termination,
     and (in the case of `normal' termination) one supplied by
     the program, see _w_a_i_t and _e_x_i_t(2).  The former byte is 0 for
     normal termination, the latter is customarily 0 for success-
     ful execution, nonzero to indicate troubles such as errone-
     ous parameters, bad or inaccessible data, or other inability
     to cope with the task at hand.  It is called variously `exit
     code', `exit status' or `return code', and is described only
     where special conventions are involved.
