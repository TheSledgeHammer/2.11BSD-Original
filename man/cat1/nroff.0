NAME
     nroff - text formatting

SYNOPSIS
     nroff [ option ] ...  [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _N_r_o_f_f formats text in the named _f_i_l_e_s for typewriter-like
     devices.  See also _t_r_o_f_f(_1). The full capabilities of _n_r_o_f_f
     are described in the _N_r_o_f_f/_T_r_o_f_f _U_s_e_r'_s _M_a_n_u_a_l.

     If no _f_i_l_e argument is present, the standard input is read.
     An argument consisting of a single minus (-) is taken to be
     a file name corresponding to the standard input.

     The options, which may appear in any order so long as they
     appear _b_e_f_o_r_e the files, are:

     -o_l_i_s_t Print only pages whose page numbers appear in the
	    comma-separated _l_i_s_t of numbers and ranges.  A range
	    _N-_M means pages _N through _M; an initial -_N means from
	    the beginning to page _N; and a final _N- means from _N
	    to the end.

     -n_N    Number first generated page _N.

     -s_N    Stop every _N pages.  _N_r_o_f_f will halt prior to every _N
	    pages (default _N=1) to allow paper loading or chang-
	    ing, and will resume upon receipt of a newline.

     -m_n_a_m_e Prepend the macro file /usr/share/tmac/tmac._n_a_m_e to
	    the input _f_i_l_e_s.

     -r_a_N   Set register _a (one-character) to _N.

     -i     Read standard input after the input files are
	    exhausted.

     -q     Invoke the simultaneous input-output mode of the rd
	    request.

     -T_n_a_m_e Prepare output for specified terminal.  Known _n_a_m_e_s
	    are 37 for the (default) Teletype Corporation Model
	    37 terminal, tn300 for the GE TermiNet 300 (or any
	    terminal without half-line capability), 300S for the
	    DASI-300S, 300 for the DASI-300, and 450 for the
	    DASI-450 (Diablo Hyterm).

     -e     Produce equally-spaced words in adjusted lines, using
	    full terminal resolution.

     -h     Use output tabs during horizontal spacing to speed
