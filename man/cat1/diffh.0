NAME
     diff - differential file and directory comparator

SYNOPSIS
     diff [ -l ] [ -r ] [ -s ] [ -cefhn ] [ -biwt ] dir1 dir2
     diff [ -cefhn ] [ -biwt ] file1 file2
     diff [ -D_s_t_r_i_n_g ] [ -biw ] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
     If both arguments are directories, _d_i_f_f sorts the contents
     of the directories by name, and then runs the regular file
     _d_i_f_f algorithm (described below) on text files which are
     different.  Binary files which differ, common subdirec-
     tories, and files which appear in only one directory are
     listed.  Options when comparing directories are:

     -l   long output format; each text file _d_i_f_f is piped
	  through _p_r(1) to paginate it, other differences are
	  remembered and summarized after all text file differ-
	  ences are reported.

     -r   causes application of _d_i_f_f recursively to common sub-
	  directories encountered.

     -s   causes _d_i_f_f to report files which are the same, which
	  are otherwise not mentioned.

     -Sname
	  starts a directory _d_i_f_f in the middle beginning with
	  file _n_a_m_e.

     When run on regular files, and when comparing text files
     which differ during directory comparison, _d_i_f_f tells what
     lines must be changed in the files to bring them into agree-
     ment.  Except in rare circumstances, _d_i_f_f finds a smallest
     sufficient set of file differences.  If neither _f_i_l_e_1 nor
     _f_i_l_e_2 is a directory, then either may be given as `-', in
     which case the standard input is used.  If _f_i_l_e_1 is a direc-
     tory, then a file in that directory whose file-name is the
     same as the file-name of _f_i_l_e_2 is used (and vice versa).

     There are several options for output format; the default
     output format contains lines of these forms:

	  _n_1 a _n_3,_n_4
	  _n_1,_n_2 d _n_3
	  _n_1,_n_2 c _n_3,_n_4

     These lines resemble _e_d commands to convert _f_i_l_e_1 into
     _f_i_l_e_2.  The numbers after the letters pertain to _f_i_l_e_2.  In
     fact, by exchanging `a' for `d' and reading backward one may
     ascertain equally how to convert _f_i_l_e_2 into _f_i_l_e_1.  As in

     _e_d, identical pairs where _n_1 = _n_2 or _n_3 = _n_4 are abbreviated
     as a single number.

     Following each of these lines come all the lines that are
     affected in the first file flagged by `<', then all the
     lines that are affected in the second file flagged by `>'.

     Except for -b, -w, -i or -t which may be given with any of
     the others, the following options are mutually exclusive:

     -e       produces a script of _a, _c and _d commands for the
	      editor _e_d, which will recreate _f_i_l_e_2 from _f_i_l_e_1.
	      In connection with -e, the following shell program
	      may help maintain multiple versions of a file.
	      Only an ancestral file ($1) and a chain of
	      version-to-version _e_d scripts ($2,$3,...) made by
	      _d_i_f_f need be on hand.  A `latest version' appears
	      on the standard output.

		      (shift; cat $*; echo '1,$p') | ed - $1

	      Extra commands are added to the output when compar-
	      ing directories with -e, so that the result is a
	      _s_h(1) script for converting text files which are
	      common to the two directories from their state in
	      _d_i_r_1 to their state in _d_i_r_2.

     -f       produces a script similar to that of -e, not useful
	      with _e_d, and in the opposite order.

     -n       produces a script similar to that of -e, but in the
	      opposite order and with a count of changed lines on
	      each insert or delete command.  This is the form
	      used by _r_c_s_d_i_f_f(1).

     -c       produces a diff with lines of context.  The default
	      is to present 3 lines of context and may be
	      changed, e.g to 10, by -c10.  With -c the output
	      format is modified slightly: the output beginning
	      with identification of the files involved and their
	      creation dates and then each change is separated by
	      a line with a dozen *'s.	The lines removed from
	      _f_i_l_e_1 are marked with `- '; those added to _f_i_l_e_2
	      are marked `+ '.	Lines which are changed from one
	      file to the other are marked in both files with
	      with `! '.

	      Changes which lie within <context> lines of each
	      other are grouped together on output.  (This is a
	      change from the previous ``diff -c'' but the
	      resulting output is usually much easier to inter-
	      pret.)

     -h       does a fast, half-hearted job.  It works only when
	      changed stretches are short and well separated, but
	      does work on files of unlimited length.

     -Dstring causes _d_i_f_f to create a merged version of _f_i_l_e_1 and
	      _f_i_l_e_2 on the standard output, with C preprocessor
	      controls included so that a compilation of the
	      result without defining _s_t_r_i_n_g is equivalent to
	      compiling _f_i_l_e_1, while defining _s_t_r_i_n_g will yield
	      _f_i_l_e_2.

     -b       causes trailing blanks (spaces and tabs) to be
	      ignored, and other strings of blanks to compare
	      equal.

     -w       is similar to -b but causes whitespace (blanks and
	      tabs) to be totally ignored.  E.g.,
	      ``if ( a == b )'' will compare equal to
	      ``if(a==b)''.

     -i       ignores the case of letters.  E.g., ``A'' will com-
	      pare equal to ``a''.

     -t       will expand tabs in output lines.  Normal or -c
	      output adds character(s) to the front of each line
	      which may screw up the indentation of the original
	      source lines and make the output listing difficult
	      to interpret.  This option will preserve the origi-
	      nal source's indentation.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Exit status is 0 for no differences, 1 for some, 2 for trou-
     ble.

BUGS
     Editing scripts produced under the -e or -f option are naive
     about creating lines consisting of a single `.'.

     When comparing directories with the -b, -w or -i options
     specified, _d_i_f_f first compares the files ala _c_m_p, and then
     decides to run the _d_i_f_f algorithm if they are not equal.
     This may cause a small amount of spurious output if the
     files then turn out to be identical because the only
