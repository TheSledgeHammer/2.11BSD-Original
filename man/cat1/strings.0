STRINGS(1)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       STRINGS(1)



NAME
     strings - find the printable strings in a object, or other
     binary, file

SYNOPSIS
     strings [ - ] [ -o ] [ -_n_u_m_b_e_r ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _S_t_r_i_n_g_s looks for ascii strings in a binary file.	A string
     is any sequence of 4 or more printing characters ending with
     a newline or a null.  Unless the - flag is given, _s_t_r_i_n_g_s
     only looks in the initialized data space of object files.
     If the -o flag is given, then each string is preceded by its
     offset in the file (in octal).  If the -_n_u_m_b_e_r flag is given
     then number is used as the minimum string length rather than
     4.

     _S_t_r_i_n_g_s is useful for identifying random object files and
     many other things.

BUGS
     The algorithm for identifying strings is extremely primi-
     tive.
