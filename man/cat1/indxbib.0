NAME
     indxbib, lookbib - build inverted index for a bibliography,
     find references in a bibliography

SYNOPSIS
     indxbib database  ...
     lookbib [ -n ] database

DESCRIPTION
     _I_n_d_x_b_i_b makes an inverted index to the named _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e_s (or
     files) for use by _l_o_o_k_b_i_b(1) and _r_e_f_e_r(1).  These files con-
     tain bibliographic references (or other kinds of informa-
     tion) separated by blank lines.

     A bibliographic reference is a set of lines, constituting
     fields of bibliographic information.  Each field starts on a
     line beginning with a ``%'', followed by a key-letter, then
     a blank, and finally the contents of the field, which may
     continue until the next line starting with ``%''.

     _I_n_d_x_b_i_b is a shell script that calls /usr/libexec/refer/mkey
     and /usr/libexec/refer/inv.  The first program, _m_k_e_y, trun-
     cates words to 6 characters, and maps upper case to lower
     case.  It also discards words shorter than 3 characters,
     words among the 100 most common English words, and numbers
     (dates) < 1900 or > 2000.	These parameters can be changed;
     see page 4 of the _R_e_f_e_r document by Mike Lesk.  The second
     program, _i_n_v, creates an entry file (.ia), a posting file
     (.ib), and a tag file (.ic), all in the working directory.

     _L_o_o_k_b_i_b uses an inverted index made by _i_n_d_x_b_i_b to find sets
     of bibliographic references.  It reads keywords typed after
     the ``>'' prompt on the terminal, and retrieves records con-
     taining all these keywords.  If nothing matches, nothing is
     returned except another ``>'' prompt.

     _L_o_o_k_b_i_b will ask if you need instructions, and will print
     some brief information if you reply ``y''.  The ``-n'' flag
     turns off the prompt for instructions.

     It is possible to search multiple databases, as long as they
     have a common index made by _i_n_d_x_b_i_b. In that case, only the
     first argument given to _i_n_d_x_b_i_b is specified to _l_o_o_k_b_i_b.

     If _l_o_o_k_b_i_b does not find the index files (the .i[abc]
     files), it looks for a reference file with the same name as
     the argument, without the suffixes.  It creates a file with
     a '.ig' suffix, suitable for use with _f_g_r_e_p. It then uses
     this fgrep file to find references.  This method is simpler
     to use, but the .ig file is slower to use than the .i[abc]
     files, and does not allow the use of multiple reference
     files.

FILES
     _x.ia, _x.ib, _x.ic, where _x is the first argument, or if these
     are not present, then _x.ig, _x

SEE ALSO
     refer(1), addbib(1), sortbib(1), roffbib(1), lookbib(1)

BUGS
     Probably all dates should be indexed, since many disciplines
     refer to literature written in the 1800s or earlier.
