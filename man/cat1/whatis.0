WHATIS(1)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual		WHATIS(1)



NAME
     whatis - describe what a command is

SYNOPSIS
     whatis command ...

DESCRIPTION
     _W_h_a_t_i_s looks up a given command and gives the header line
     from the manual section.  You can then run the _m_a_n(1) com-
     mand to get more information.  If the line starts
     `name(section) ...' you can do `man section name' to get the
     documentation for it.  Try `whatis ed' and then you should
     do `man 1 ed' to get the manual.

     _W_h_a_t_i_s is actually just the -f option to the _m_a_n(1) command.
