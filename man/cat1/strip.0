NAME
     strip - remove symbols and relocation bits

SYNOPSIS
     strip name ...

DESCRIPTION
     _S_t_r_i_p removes the symbol table and relocation bits ordi-
     narily attached to the output of the assembler and loader.
     This is useful to save space after a program has been
     debugged.

     The effect of _s_t_r_i_p is the same as use of the -s option of
     _l_d.

FILES
     /tmp/stm? temporary file
