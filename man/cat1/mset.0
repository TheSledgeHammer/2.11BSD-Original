NAME
     mset - retrieve ASCII to IBM 3270 keyboard map

SYNOPSIS
     mset

DESCRIPTION
     _M_s_e_t retrieves mapping information for the ASCII keyboard to
     IBM 3270 terminal special functions.  Normally, these map-
     pings are found in /_u_s_r/_s_h_a_r_e/_m_i_s_c/_m_a_p_3_2_7_0 (see _m_a_p_3_2_7_0(5)).
     This information is used by the _t_n_3_2_7_0 command (see
     _t_n_3_2_7_0(1)).

     _M_s_e_t can be used store the mapping information in the pro-
     cess environment in order to avoid scanning
     /_u_s_r/_s_h_a_r_e/_m_i_s_c/_m_a_p_3_2_7_0 each time _t_n_3_2_7_0 is invoked.  To do
     this, place the following command in your ._l_o_g_i_n file:

	  set noglob; setenv MAP3270 "`mset`"; unset noglob

     _M_s_e_t first determines the user's terminal type from the
     environment variable TERM.  Normally _m_s_e_t then uses the file
     /_u_s_r/_s_h_a_r_e/_m_i_s_c/_m_a_p_3_2_7_0 to find the keyboard mapping for
     that terminal.  However, if the environment variable MAP3270
     exists and contains the entry for the specified terminal,
     then that definition is used.  If the value of MAP3270
     begins with a slash (`/') then it is assumed to be the full
     pathname of an alternate mapping file and that file is
     searched first.  In any case, if the mapping for the termi-
     nal is not found in the environment, nor in an alternate map
     file, nor in the standard map file, then the same search is
     performed for an entry for a terminal type of unknown. If
     that search also fails, then a default mapping is used.

FILES
     /usr/share/misc/map3270	    keyboard mapping for known
     terminals

SEE ALSO
     tn3270(1), map3270(5)

BUGS
     If the entry for the specific terminal exceeds 1024 bytes,
     _c_s_h(1) will fail to set the environment variable.	_M_s_e_t
     should probably detect this case and output the path to the
     _m_a_p_3_2_7_0 file instead of the terminal entry.
