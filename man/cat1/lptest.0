NAME
     lptest - generate lineprinter ripple pattern

SYNOPSIS
     lptest [ length [ count ] ]

DESCRIPTION
     _L_p_t_e_s_t writes the traditional "ripple test" pattern on stan-
     dard output.  In 96 lines, this pattern will print all 96
     printable ASCII characters in each position.  While origi-
     nally created to test printers, it is quite useful for test-
     ing terminals, driving terminal ports for debugging pur-
     poses, or any other task where a quick supply of random data
     is needed.

     The _l_e_n_g_t_h argument specifies the output line length if the
     the default length of 79 is inappropriate.

     The _c_o_u_n_t argument specifies the number of output lines to
     be generated if the default count of 200 is inappropriate.
     Note that if _c_o_u_n_t is to be specified, _l_e_n_g_t_h must be also
     be specified.
