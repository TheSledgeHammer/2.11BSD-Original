ECHO(1)             UNIX Programmer's Manual		  ECHO(1)



NAME
     echo - echo arguments

SYNOPSIS
     echo [ -n ] [ arg ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _E_c_h_o writes its arguments separated by blanks and terminated
     by a newline on the standard output.  If the flag -n is
     used, no newline is added to the output.

     _E_c_h_o is useful for producing diagnostics in shell programs
     and for writing constant data on pipes.  To send diagnostics
     to the standard error file, do `echo ... 1>&2'.
