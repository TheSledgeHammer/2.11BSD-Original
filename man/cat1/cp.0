NAME
     cp - copy

SYNOPSIS
     cp [ -ip ] file1 file2

     cp [ -ipr ] file ... directory

DESCRIPTION
     _F_i_l_e_1 is copied onto _f_i_l_e_2.  By default, the mode and owner
     of _f_i_l_e_2 are preserved if it already existed; otherwise the
     mode of the source file modified by the current _u_m_a_s_k(2) is
     used.  The -p option causes _c_p to attempt to preserve
     (duplicate) in its copies the modification times and modes
     of the source files, ignoring the present _u_m_a_s_k.

     In the second form, one or more _f_i_l_e_s are copied into the
     _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y with their original file-names.

     _C_p refuses to copy a file onto itself.

     If the -i option is specified, _c_p will prompt the user with
     the name of the file whenever the copy will cause an old
     file to be overwritten. An answer of 'y' will cause _c_p to
     continue. Any other answer will prevent it from overwriting
     the file.

     If the -r option is specified and any of the source files
     are directories, _c_p copies each subtree rooted at that name;
     in this case the destination must be a directory.
