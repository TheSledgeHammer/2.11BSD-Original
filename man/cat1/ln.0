NAME
     ln - make links

SYNOPSIS
     ln [ -s ] sourcename [ targetname ]
     ln [ -s ] sourcename1 sourcename2 [ sourcename3 ... ] tar-
     getdirectory

DESCRIPTION
     A link is a directory entry referring to a file; the same
     file (together with its size, all its protection informa-
     tion, etc.) may have several links to it.	There are two
     kinds of links: hard links and symbolic links.

     By default _l_n makes hard links.  A hard link to a file is
     indistinguishable from the original directory entry; any
     changes to a file are effective independent of the name used
     to reference the file.  Hard links may not span file systems
     and may not refer to directories.

     The -s option causes _l_n to create symbolic links.	A sym-
     bolic link contains the name of the file to which it is
     linked.  The referenced file is used when an _o_p_e_n(2) opera-
     tion is performed on the link.  A _s_t_a_t(2) on a symbolic link
     will return the linked-to file; an _l_s_t_a_t(2) must be done to
     obtain information about the link.  The _r_e_a_d_l_i_n_k(2) call may
     be used to read the contents of a symbolic link.  Symbolic
     links may span file systems and may refer to directories.

     Given one or two arguments, _l_n creates a link to an existing
     file _s_o_u_r_c_e_n_a_m_e.  If _t_a_r_g_e_t_n_a_m_e is given, the link has that
     name; _t_a_r_g_e_t_n_a_m_e may also be a directory in which to place
     the link; otherwise it is placed in the current directory.
     If only the directory is specified, the link will be made to
     the last component of _s_o_u_r_c_e_n_a_m_e.

     Given more than two arguments, _l_n makes links in _t_a_r_g_e_t_-
     _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y to all the named source files.  The links made
     will have the same name as the files being linked to.
