NAME
     fold - fold long lines for finite width output device

SYNOPSIS
     fold [ -width ] [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
     _F_o_l_d is a filter which will fold the contents of the speci-
     fied files, or the standard input if no files are specified,
     breaking the lines to have maximum width _w_i_d_t_h. The default
     for _w_i_d_t_h is 80.  _W_i_d_t_h should be a multiple of 8 if tabs
     are present, or the tabs should be expanded using _e_x_p_a_n_d(1)
     before coming to _f_o_l_d.

SEE ALSO
     expand(1)

BUGS
     If underlining is present it may be messed up by folding.
