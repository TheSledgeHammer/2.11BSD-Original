NAME
     date - print and set the date

SYNOPSIS
     date [-nu] [-d dst] [-t timezone] [yymmddhhmm [.ss] ]

DESCRIPTION
     If no arguments are given, the current date and time are
     printed.  Providing an argument will set the desired date;
     only the superuser can set the date.  The -_d and -_t flags
     set the kernel's values for daylight savings time and
     minutes west of GMT.  If _d_s_t is non-zero, future calls to
     _g_e_t_t_i_m_e_o_f_d_a_y(2) will return a non-zero _t_z__d_s_t_t_i_m_e.  _T_i_m_e_z_o_n_e
     provides the number of minutes returned by future calls to
     _g_e_t_t_i_m_e_o_f_d_a_y(2) in _t_z__m_i_n_u_t_e_s_w_e_s_t.  The -_u flag is used to
     display or set the date in GMT (universal) time.  _y_y
     represents the last two digits of the year; the first _m_m is
     the month number; _d_d is the day number; _h_h is the hour
     number (24 hour system); the second _m_m is the minute number;
     ._s_s is optional and represents the seconds.  For example:

	  date 8506131627

     sets the date to June 13 1985, 4:27 PM.  The year, month and
     day may be omitted; the default values will be the current
     ones.  The system operates in GMT.  _D_a_t_e takes care of the
     conversion to and from local standard and daylight-saving
     time.

     If _t_i_m_e_d(_8) is running to synchronize the clocks of machines
     in a local area network, _d_a_t_e sets the time globally on all
     those machines unless the -n option is given.

FILES
     /usr/adm/wtmp to record time-setting.  In /usr/adm/messages,
     _d_a_t_e records the name of the user setting the time.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Exit status is 0 on success, 1 on complete failure to set
     the date, and 2 on successfully setting the local date but
     failing globally.

     Occasionally, when _t_i_m_e_d synchronizes the time on many
     hosts, the setting of a new time value may require more than
     a few seconds.  On these occasions, _d_a_t_e prints: `Network
     time being set'.  The message `Communication error with
     timed' occurs when the communication between _d_a_t_e and _t_i_m_e_d

     fails.

BUGS
     The system attempts to keep the date in a format closely
     compatible with VMS.  VMS, however, uses local time (rather
     than GMT) and does not understand daylight-saving time.
     Thus, if you use both UNIX and VMS, VMS will be running on
     GMT.
