NAME
     graph - draw a graph

SYNOPSIS
     graph [ option ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _G_r_a_p_h with no options takes pairs of numbers from the stan-
     dard input as abscissas and ordinates of a graph.	Succes-
     sive points are connected by straight lines.  The graph is
     encoded on the standard output for display by the _p_l_o_t(1G)
     filters.

     If the coordinates of a point are followed by a nonnumeric
     string, that string is printed as a label beginning on the
     point.  Labels may be surrounded with quotes "...", in which
     case they may be empty or contain blanks and numbers; labels
     never contain newlines.

     The following options are recognized, each as a separate
     argument.

     -a   Supply abscissas automatically (they are missing from
	  the input); spacing is given by the next argument
	  (default 1).	A second optional argument is the start-
	  ing point for automatic abscissas (default 0 or lower
	  limit given by -x).

     -b   Break (disconnect) the graph after each label in the
	  input.

     -c   Character string given by next argument is default
	  label for each point.

     -g   Next argument is grid style, 0 no grid, 1 frame with
	  ticks, 2 full grid (default).

     -l   Next argument is label for graph.

     -m   Next argument is mode (style) of connecting lines: 0
	  disconnected, 1 connected (default).	Some devices give
	  distinguishable line styles for other small integers.

     -s   Save screen, don't erase before plotting.

     -x [ l ]
	  If l is present, x axis is logarithmic.  Next 1 (or 2)
	  arguments are lower (and upper) _x limits.  Third argu-
	  ment, if present, is grid spacing on _x axis.	Normally
	  these quantities are determined automatically.

     -y [ l ]

	  Similarly for _y.

     -h   Next argument is fraction of space for height.

     -w   Similarly for width.

     -r   Next argument is fraction of space to move right before
	  plotting.

     -u   Similarly to move up before plotting.

     -t   Transpose horizontal and vertical axes.  (Option -x now
	  applies to the vertical axis.)

     A legend indicating grid range is produced with a grid
     unless the -s option is present.

     If a specified lower limit exceeds the upper limit, the axis
     is reversed.

BUGS
     _G_r_a_p_h stores all points internally and drops those for which
     there isn't room.
     Segments that run out of bounds are dropped, not windowed.
     Logarithmic axes may not be reversed.
