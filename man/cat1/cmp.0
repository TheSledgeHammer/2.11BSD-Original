NAME
     cmp - compare two files

SYNOPSIS
     cmp [ -l ] [ -s ] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
     The two files are compared.  (If _f_i_l_e_1 is `-', the standard
     input is used.) Under default options, _c_m_p makes no comment
     if the files are the same; if they differ, it announces the
     byte and line number at which the difference occurred.  If
     one file is an initial subsequence of the other, that fact
     is noted.

     Options:

     -l    Print the byte number (decimal) and the differing
	   bytes (octal) for each difference.

     -s    Print nothing for differing files; return codes only.

SEE ALSO
     diff(1), comm(1)

DIAGNOSTICS
     Exit code 0 is returned for identical files, 1 for different
     files, and 2 for an inaccessible or missing argument.
