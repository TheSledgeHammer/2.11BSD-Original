NAME
     who - who is on the system

SYNOPSIS
     who [ who-file ] [ am I ]

DESCRIPTION
     _W_h_o, without an argument, lists the login name, terminal
     name, and login time for each current UNIX user.

     Without an argument, _w_h_o examines the /_v_a_r/_r_u_n/_u_t_m_p file to
     obtain its information.  If a file is given, that file is
     examined.	Typically the given file will be /usr/adm/wtmp,
     which contains a record of all the logins since it was
     created.  Then _w_h_o lists logins, logouts, and crashes since
     the creation of the wtmp file.  Each login is listed with
     user name, terminal name (with `/dev/' suppressed), and date
     and time.	When an argument is given, logouts produce a
     similar line without a user name.	Reboots produce a line
     with `x' in the place of the device name, and a fossil time
     indicative of when the system went down.

     With two arguments, as in `who am I' (and also `who are
     you'), _w_h_o tells who you are logged in as.
