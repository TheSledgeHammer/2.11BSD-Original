NAME
     tc - photoypesetter simulator

SYNOPSIS
     tc [ -t ] [ -sN ] [ -pL ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
     _T_c interprets its input (standard input default) as device
     codes for a Graphic Systems phototypesetter (cat).  The
     standard output of _t_c is intended for a Tektronix 4015 (a
     4014 terminal with ASCII and APL character sets).	The six-
     teen typesetter sizes are mapped into the 4014's four sizes;
     the entire TROFF character set is drawn using the 4014's
     character generator, using overstruck combinations where
     necessary.  Typical usage:

		    troff -t file | tc

     At the end of each page _t_c waits for a newline (empty line)
     from the keyboard before continuing on to the next page.  In
     this wait state, the command e will suppress the screen
     erase before the next page; sN will cause the next N pages
     to be skipped; and !line will send line to the shell.

     The command line options are:

     -t   Don't wait between pages; for directing output into a
	  file.

     -sN  Skip the first N pages.

     -pL  Set page length to L.  L may include the scale factors
	  p (points), i (inches), c (centimeters), and P (picas);
	  default is picas.

     '-_l _w'
	  Multiply the default aspect ratio, 1.5, of a displayed
	  page by _l/_w.

SEE ALSO
     troff(1), plot(1G)

BUGS
     Font distinctions are lost.
     _t_c's character set is limited to ASCII in just one size.
     The aspect ratio option is unbelievable.
