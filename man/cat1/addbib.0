NAME
     addbib - create or extend bibliographic database

SYNOPSIS
     addbib  [ -p  promptfile ]  [ -a ]  database

DESCRIPTION
     When this program starts up, answering ``y'' to the initial
     ``Instructions?'' prompt yields directions; typing ``n'' or
     RETURN skips them.  _A_d_d_b_i_b then prompts for various biblio-
     graphic fields, reads responses from the terminal, and sends
     output records to a _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e. A null response (just RETURN)
     means to leave out that field.  A minus sign (-) means to go
     back to the previous field.  A trailing backslash allows a
     field to be continued on the next line.  The repeating
     ``Continue?'' prompt allows the user either to resume by
     typing ``y'' or RETURN, to quit the current session by typ-
     ing ``n'' or ``q'', or to edit the _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e with any system
     editor (_v_i, _e_x, _e_d_i_t, _e_d).

     The -a option suppresses prompting for an abstract; asking
     for an abstract is the default.  Abstracts are ended with a
     CTRL-d.  The -p option causes _a_d_d_b_i_b to use a new prompting
     skeleton, defined in _p_r_o_m_p_t_f_i_l_e. This file should contain
     prompt strings, a tab, and the key-letters to be written to
     the _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e.

     The most common key-letters and their meanings are given
     below.  _A_d_d_b_i_b insulates you from these key-letters, since
     it gives you prompts in English, but if you edit the
     bibliography file later on, you will need to know this
     information.
