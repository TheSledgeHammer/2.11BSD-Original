NAME
     ruptime - show host status of local machines

SYNOPSIS
     ruptime [ -a ] [ -r ] [ -l ] [ -t ] [ -u ]

DESCRIPTION
     _R_u_p_t_i_m_e gives a status line like _u_p_t_i_m_e for each machine on
     the local network; these are formed from packets broadcast
     by each host on the network once a minute.

     Machines for which no status report has been received for 11
     minutes are shown as being down.

     Users idle an hour or more are not counted unless the -a
     flag is given.

     Normally, the listing is sorted by host name.  The -l , -t ,
     and -u flags specify sorting by load average, uptime, and
     number of users, respectively.  The -r flag reverses the
     sort order.

FILES
     /usr/spool/rwho/whod.*   data files
