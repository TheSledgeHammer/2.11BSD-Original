NAME
     strcompact - string compaction for object files

SYNOPSIS
     strcompact [ object_name ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     strcompact scans the symbol and string tables of an object
     file looking for multiple references in the symbol table to
     the same string.  The string offset of symbol table entries
     is updated to preserve only one copy of the string.

     strcompact cut the size of the kernel string table by about
     25%.

     The user must have write permission to the object/executable
     file.

     strcompact writes to _s_t_d_e_r_r the number of shared strings
     found.

     strcompact exits 0 if successful, and >0 if an error
     occurred.

SEE ALSO
     sort(1), symcompact(1), symorder(1), uniq(1)

BUGS
     Execution speed leaves much to be desired - on a 11/73 it
     takes about 4 minutes to process the string table of the
     kernel.  Fortunately this is only done once when the kernel
     is created.

     Although strcompact may be run on .o files as well as exe-
     cutables but this is probably not worth the trouble since
     the linker will not create shared strings in the final exe-
     cutable.
