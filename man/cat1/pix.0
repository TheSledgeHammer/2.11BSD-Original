NAME
     pix - Pascal interpreter and executor

SYNOPSIS
     pix [ -blnpstuwz ] [ -i name ...  ] name.p [ argument ...	]

DESCRIPTION
     _P_i_x is a `load and go' version of Pascal which combines the
     functions of the interpreter code translator _p_i and the exe-
     cutor _p_x.	It uses _p_i to translate the program in the file
     _n_a_m_e._p and, if there were no fatal errors during transla-
     tion, causes the resulting interpreter code to be executed
     by _p_x with the specified arguments.  A temporary file is
     used for the object code; the file _o_b_j is neither created
     nor destroyed.
