NAME
     login - sign on

SYNOPSIS
     login [ -p ] [ username ]

DESCRIPTION
     The _l_o_g_i_n command is used when a user initially signs on, or
     it may be used at any time to change from one user to
     another.  The latter case is the one summarized above and
     described here.  See "How to Get Started" for how to dial up
     initially.

     If _l_o_g_i_n is invoked without an argument, it asks for a user
     name, and, if appropriate, a password.  Echoing is turned
     off (if possible) during the typing of the password, so it
     will not appear on the written record of the session.

     After a successful login, accounting files are updated and
     the user is informed of the existence of mail.  The message
     of the day is printed, as is the time of his last login.
     Both are suppressed if he has a ".hushlogin" file in his
     home directory; this is mostly used to make life easier for
     non-human users, such as _u_u_c_p.

     _L_o_g_i_n initializes the user and group IDs and the working
     directory, then executes a command interpreter (usually
     _c_s_h(1)) according to specifications found in a password
     file.  Argument 0 of the command interpreter is the name of
     the command interpreter with a leading dash ("-").

     Login also modifies the environment _e_n_v_i_r_o_n(7) with informa-
     tion specifying home directory, command interpreter, termi-
     nal type (if available) and user name.  The `-p' argument
     causes the remainder of the environment to be preserved,
     otherwise any previous environment is discarded.

     If the file /etc/nologin exists, _l_o_g_i_n prints its contents
     on the user's terminal and exits. This is used by _s_h_u_t_-
     _d_o_w_n(8) to stop users logging in when the system is about to
     go down.

     Login is recognized by _s_h(1) and _c_s_h(1) and executed
     directly (without forking).

DIAGNOSTICS
     "Login incorrect," if the name or the password is bad.
     "No Shell", "cannot open password file", "no directory":
     consult a programming counselor.

BUGS
     An undocumented option, -r is used by the remote login
     server, _r_l_o_g_i_n_d(8C) to force _l_o_g_i_n to enter into an initial
     connection protocol.  -h is used by _t_e_l_n_e_t_d(8C) and other
     servers to list the host from which the connection was
     received.
