NAME
     ptx - permuted index

SYNOPSIS
     ptx [ option ] ...  [ input [ output ] ]

DESCRIPTION
     _P_t_x generates a permuted index to file _i_n_p_u_t on file _o_u_t_p_u_t
     (standard input and output default).  It has three phases:
     the first does the permutation, generating one line for each
     keyword in an input line.	The keyword is rotated to the
     front.  The permuted file is then sorted.	Finally, the
     sorted lines are rotated so the keyword comes at the middle
     of the page.  _P_t_x produces output in the form:

	  .xx "tail" "before keyword" "keyword and after" "head"

     where .xx may be an _n_r_o_f_f or _t_r_o_f_f(1) macro for user-defined
     formatting.  The _b_e_f_o_r_e _k_e_y_w_o_r_d and _k_e_y_w_o_r_d _a_n_d _a_f_t_e_r fields
     incorporate as much of the line as will fit around the key-
     word when it is printed at the middle of the page.  _T_a_i_l and
     _h_e_a_d, at least one of which is an empty string "", are
     wrapped-around pieces small enough to fit in the unused
     space at the opposite end of the line.  When original text
     must be discarded, `/' marks the spot.

     The following options can be applied:

     -f   Fold upper and lower case letters for sorting.

     -t   Prepare the output for the phototypesetter; the default
	  line length is 100 characters.

     -w _n Use the next argument, _n, as the width of the output
	  line.  The default line length is 72 characters.

     -g _n Use the next argument, _n, as the number of characters
	  to allow for each gap among the four parts of the line
	  as finally printed.  The default gap is 3 characters.

     -o only
	  Use as keywords only the words given in the _o_n_l_y file.

     -i ignore
	  Do not use as keywords any words given in the _i_g_n_o_r_e
	  file.  If the -i and -o options are missing, use
	  /_u_s_r/_s_h_a_r_e/_m_i_s_c/_e_i_g_n as the _i_g_n_o_r_e file.

     -b break
	  Use the characters in the _b_r_e_a_k file to separate words.
	  In any case, tab, newline, and space characters are
	  always used as break characters.

     -r   Take any leading nonblank characters of each input line
	  to be a reference identifier (as to a page or chapter)
	  separate from the text of the line.  Attach that iden-
	  tifier as a 5th field on each output line.

     The index for this manual was generated using _p_t_x.
