NAME
     chflags - change file flags

SYNOPSIS
     chflags [-R] [-f]flags file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The chflags utility modifies the file flags of the listed
     files as specified by the flags operand.

     The options are as follows:

     -R             Change the file flags for the file hierar-
		    chies rooted in the files instead of just the
		    files themselves.

     -f chflags will not complain if it fails to change the flags
     on a file.

     Flags are a comma separated list of keywords.  The following
     keywords are currently defined:

     arch		 No effect.  This bit is defined and will
			 be set/cleared as requested but nothing
			 in the system makes use of it yet.

     dump		 Set the dump flag

     sappnd		 Set the system append-only flag (super-
			 user only)

     schg		 Set the system immutable flag (super-
			 user only)

     uappnd		 Set the user append-only flag (owner or
			 super-user only)

     uchg		 Set the user immutable flag (owner or
			 super-user only)

     Putting the letters no before an option causes the flag to
     be turned off.  For example:

     nodump		 the file should never be dumped

     Symbolic links do not have flags and are silently ignored by
     chflags. When the -R option is given and symbolic links are
     encountered they are not traversed.  This is the same
     behaviour as chmod(1).

     The chflags utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
     occurs.
