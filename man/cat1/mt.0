NAME
     mt - magnetic tape manipulating program

SYNOPSIS
     mt [ -f _t_a_p_e_n_a_m_e ] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [ _c_o_u_n_t ]

DESCRIPTION
     _M_t is used to give commands to a magnetic tape drive.  If a
     tape name is not specified, the environment variable TAPE is
     used;  if TAPE does not exist, _m_t uses the device
     /_d_e_v/_r_m_t_1_2.  Note that _t_a_p_e_n_a_m_e must reference a raw (not
     block) tape device.  By default _m_t performs the requested
     operation once.  Operations may be performed multiple times
     by specifying _c_o_u_n_t.

     The available commands are listed below.  Only as many char-
     acters as are required to uniquely identify a command need
     be specified.

     eof, weof
	  Write _c_o_u_n_t end-of-file marks at the current position
	  on the tape.

     fsf  Forward space _c_o_u_n_t files.

     fsr  Forward space _c_o_u_n_t records.

     bsf  Back space _c_o_u_n_t files.

     bsr  Back space _c_o_u_n_t records.

     rewind
	  Rewind the tape (_C_o_u_n_t is ignored).

     offline, rewoffl
	  Rewind the tape and place the tape unit off-line (_C_o_u_n_t
	  is ignored).

     status
	  Print status information about the tape unit.

     cacheon
	  Enable the readahead/writebehind cache on the tape
	  unit.

     cacheoff
	  Turn off the readahead/writebehind cache on the tape
	  unit.

     _M_t returns a 0 exit status when the operation(s) were suc-
     cessful, 1 if the command was unrecognized, and 2 if an
     operation failed.

MT(1)		    UNIX Programmer's Manual		    MT(1)



     The cacheon and cacheoff commands currently only apply to
     the TMSCP driver and then only for certain drives such as
     the TU81+.  No error is produced by the TMSCP driver if the
     cache commands are used.  Other drivers will return an error
     code since they do not recognize the MTCACHE and MTNOCACHE
     functions codes.  See mtio(4).
