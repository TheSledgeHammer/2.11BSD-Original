NAME
     as - assembler

SYNOPSIS
     as [ -u ] [ -V ] [ -o objfile ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _A_s assembles the concatenation of the named files.  The
     options are:

     -u   Treat all undefined symbols in the assembly as external
	  globals.

     -V   Produce an object suitable for loading into an
	  automatic text overlaid program.

     -o   Use _o_b_j_f_i_l for the name of the resultant object.  If
	  this is omitted, _a._o_u_t is used.  If no errors occurred
	  during the assembly and if there were no unresolved
	  external references, it is made executable.

     The special file name -- serves two purposes.  It signals
     the end of all options and causes _s_t_d_i_n to be read for
     input.  Thus it is now possible to pipe data to the assem-
     bler:

     /lib/cpp -E foo.s | sed -e ';^#;/;' | as -o foo.o --

     The file name -- may be placed between normal files, when
     EOF is detected on _s_t_d_i_n the next file in the argument list
     is opened and read.

     If no input files are specified then _s_t_d_i_n is read.

FILES
     /tmp/atm1 temporary
     a.out     object

DIAGNOSTICS
     When an input file cannot be read, its name followed by a
     question mark is typed and assembly ceases.  When syntactic
     or semantic errors occur, a single-character diagnostic is
     typed out together with the line number and the file name in
     which it occurred.  Errors in pass 1 cause cancellation of
     pass 2.  The possible errors are:

     )	Parentheses error
     ]	Parentheses error
