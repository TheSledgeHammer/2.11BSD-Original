NAME
     hostid - set or print identifier of current host system

SYNOPSIS
     hostid [ identifier ]

DESCRIPTION
     The _h_o_s_t_i_d command prints the identifier of the current host
     in hexadecimal.  This numeric value is expected to be unique
     across all hosts and is commonly set to the host's Internet
     address.  The super-user can set the hostid by giving a hex-
     adecimal argument or the hostname; this is usually done in
     the startup script /etc/rc.local.
