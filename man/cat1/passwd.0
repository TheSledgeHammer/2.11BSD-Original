NAME
     passwd - change password file information

SYNOPSIS
     passwd [ user ]

DESCRIPTION
     _P_a_s_s_w_d changes the user's password.  First, the user is
     prompted for their old password, and then, if that is
     correct, for the new password.  The new password must be
     entered twice to forestall any typing errors.  The super-
     user is not prompted for the old password.

     Once the password has been verified, _p_a_s_s_w_d uses _m_k_p_a_s_s_w_d(8)
     to update the user database.  This is run in the background,
     and, at very large sites could take several minutes.  Until
     this update is completed, the password file is unavailable
     for other updates and the new password will not be available
     to programs.

FILES
     /etc/master.passwd       the user database
