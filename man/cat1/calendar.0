NAME
     calendar - reminder service

SYNOPSIS
     calendar [ - ]

DESCRIPTION
     _C_a_l_e_n_d_a_r consults the file `calendar' in the current direc-
     tory and prints out lines that contain today's or tomorrow's
     date anywhere in the line.  Most reasonable month-day dates
     such as `Dec. 7,' `december 7,' `12/7,' etc., are recog-
     nized, but not `7 December' or `7/12'.  If you give the
     month as ``*'' with a date, i.e. ``* 1'', that day in any
     month will do.  On weekends `tomorrow' extends through Mon-
     day.

     When an argument is present, _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r does its job for every
     user who has a file `calendar' in his login directory and
     sends him any positive results by _m_a_i_l(1).  Normally this is
     done daily in the wee hours under control of _c_r_o_n(8).

     The file `calendar' is first run through the ``C'' prepro-
     cessor, /_l_i_b/_c_p_p, to include any other calendar files speci-
     fied with the usual ``#include'' syntax.  Included calendars
     will usually be shared by all users, maintained and docu-
     mented by the local administration.

FILES
     calendar
     /usr/libexec/calendar to figure out today's and tomorrow's
     dates
     /etc/passwd
     /tmp/cal*
     /lib/cpp, egrep, sed, mail as subprocesses

SEE ALSO
     at(1), cron(8), mail(1)

BUGS
     _C_a_l_e_n_d_a_r'_s extended idea of `tomorrow' doesn't account for
     holidays.
