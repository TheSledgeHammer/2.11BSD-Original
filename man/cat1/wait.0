WAIT(1)             UNIX Programmer's Manual		  WAIT(1)



NAME
     wait - await completion of process

SYNOPSIS
     wait

DESCRIPTION
     Wait until all processes started with & have completed, and
     report on abnormal terminations.

     Because the _w_a_i_t(2) system call must be executed in the
     parent process, the Shell itself executes _w_a_i_t, without
     creating a new process.

SEE ALSO
     sh(1)

BUGS
     Not all the processes of a 3- or more-stage pipeline are
     children of the Shell, and thus can't be waited for.  (This
     bug does not apply to _c_s_h(1).)
