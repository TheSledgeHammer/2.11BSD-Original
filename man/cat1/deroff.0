NAME
     deroff - remove nroff, troff, tbl and eqn constructs

SYNOPSIS
     deroff [ -w ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _D_e_r_o_f_f reads each file in sequence and removes all _n_r_o_f_f and
     _t_r_o_f_f command lines, backslash constructions, macro defini-
     tions, _e_q_n constructs (between `.EQ' and `.EN' lines or
     between delimiters), and table descriptions and writes the
     remainder on the standard output.	_D_e_r_o_f_f follows chains of
     included files (`.so' and `.nx' commands); if a file has
     already been included, a `.so' is ignored and a `.nx' ter-
     minates execution.  If no input file is given, _d_e_r_o_f_f reads
     from the standard input file.

     If the -w flag is given, the output is a word list, one
     `word' (string of letters, digits, and apostrophes, begin-
     ning with a letter; apostrophes are removed) per line, and
     all other characters ignored.  Otherwise, the output follows
     the original, with the deletions mentioned above.

SEE ALSO
     troff(1), eqn(1), tbl(1)

BUGS
     _D_e_r_o_f_f is not a complete _t_r_o_f_f interpreter, so it can be
     confused by subtle constructs.  Most errors result in too
     much rather than too little output.
