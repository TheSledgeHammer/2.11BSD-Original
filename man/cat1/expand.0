EXPAND(1)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual		EXPAND(1)



NAME
     expand, unexpand - expand tabs to spaces, and vice versa

SYNOPSIS
     expand [ -tabstop ] [ -tab1,tab2,...,tabn ] [ file ...  ]
     unexpand [ -a ] [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
     _E_x_p_a_n_d processes the named files or the standard input writ-
     ing the standard output with tabs changed into blanks.
     Backspace characters are preserved into the output and
     decrement the column count for tab calculations.  _E_x_p_a_n_d is
     useful for pre-processing character files (before sorting,
     looking at specific columns, etc.) that contain tabs.

     If a single _t_a_b_s_t_o_p argument is given, then tabs are set
     _t_a_b_s_t_o_p spaces apart instead of the default 8.  If multiple
     tabstops are given then the tabs are set at those specific
     columns.

     _U_n_e_x_p_a_n_d puts tabs back into the data from the standard
     input or the named files and writes the result on the stan-
     dard output.  By default, only leading blanks and tabs are
     reconverted to maximal strings of tabs.  If the -a option is
     given, then tabs are inserted whenever they would compress
     the resultant file by replacing two or more characters.
