NAME
     ratfor - rational Fortran dialect

SYNOPSIS
     ratfor [ option ... ] [ filename ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _R_a_t_f_o_r converts a rational dialect of Fortran into ordinary
     irrational Fortran.  _R_a_t_f_o_r provides control flow constructs
     essentially identical to those in C:

     statement grouping:
	  { statement; statement; statement }

     decision-making:
	  if (condition) statement [ else statement ]
	  switch (integer value) {
	       case integer:  statement
	       ...
	       [ default: ]   statement
	  }

     loops:
	  while (condition) statement
	  for (expression; condition; expression) statement
	  do limits statement
	  repeat statement [ until (condition) ]
	  break
	  next

     and some syntactic sugar to make programs easier to read and write:

     free form input:
	  multiple statements/line; automatic continuation

     comments:
	  # this is a comment

     translation of relationals:
	  >, >=, etc., become .GT., .GE., etc.

     return (expression)
	  returns expression to caller from function

     define:
	  define name replacement

     include:
	  include filename

     _R_a_t_f_o_r is best used with _f_7_7(1).
