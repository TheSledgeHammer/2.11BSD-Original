NAME
     mkdep - construct Makefile dependency list

SYNOPSIS
     mkdep [ -f makefile ] [ -p ] flags file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _M_k_d_e_p takes a set of flags for the C compiler and a list of
     C source files as arguments and constructs a set of include
     file dependencies.  It attaches this dependency list to the
     end of the file ``Makefile''.  An example of its use in a
     makefile might be:

	  CFLAGS= -O -I../include -I.
	  SRCS= file1.c file2.c

	  depend:
	       mkdep ${CFLAGS} ${SRCS}

     where the macro SRCS is the list of C source files and the macro
     CFLAGS is the list of flags for the C compiler.  The -f option
     provides _m_k_d_e_p with a name other than ``Makefile'' to be edited.
     If the -p option is provided, _m_k_d_e_p produces dependencies
     of the form ``program: program.c'' so that subsequent makes will
     produce _p_r_o_g_r_a_m directly from its C module rather than using an
     intermediate ._o module.  This is useful in directories that
     contain many programs, each of whose source is contained in a single
     C module.
