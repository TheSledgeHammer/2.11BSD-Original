NAME
     ranlib - table-of-contents for archive libraries

SYNOPSIS
     ranlib [-t] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _R_a_n_l_i_b creates a table of external references for archive
     libraries, normally used by the loader, _l_d(1).  This table
     is is named ``__.SYMDEF'' and is prepended to the archive.
     Files in the archive which are not executable and symbols
     which are uninteresting to the loader are ignored.

     The options are as follows:

     -t   Set the modification time of the __.SYMDEF file.  This
	  time is compared by the loader with the modification
	  time of the archive to verify that the table is up-to-
	  date with respect to the archive.  If the modification
	  time has been changed without any change to the archive
	  (for example, by a _c_p(1)), the -_t option can be used to
	  ``touch'' the modification time so that it appears that
	  the table is up-to-date.

FILES
     /tmp	   default temporary file directory

     ranlib.XXXXXX temporary file names
