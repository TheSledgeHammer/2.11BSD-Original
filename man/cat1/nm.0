NAME
     nm - print name list (2BSD)

SYNOPSIS
     nm [ -gnopru ] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _N_m prints the name list (symbol table) of each object _f_i_l_e
     in the argument list.  If an argument is an archive, a list-
     ing for each object file in the archive will be produced.
     If no _f_i_l_e is given, the symbols in "a.out" are listed.

     Each symbol name is preceded by its value (blanks if unde-
     fined) and one of the letters U (undefined), A (absolute), T
     (text segment symbol), D (data segment symbol), B (bss seg-
     ment symbol), C (common symbol), or f file name.  If the
     symbol is local (non-external) the type letter is in lower
     case.  If the file is an overlaid executable, the overlay
     number is printed after the name.	The number is printed if
     the symbol is in an overlay or if it is the entry point (in
     the base segment) for a subroutine in an overlay.	The out-
     put is sorted alphabetically.

     Options are:

     -g   Print only global (external) symbols.

     -n   Sort numerically rather than alphabetically.

     -o   Prepend file or archive element name to each output
	  line rather than only once.

     -p   Don't sort; print in symbol-table order.

     -r   Sort in reverse order.

     -u   Print only undefined symbols.
