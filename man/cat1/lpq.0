NAME
     lpq - spool queue examination program

SYNOPSIS
     lpq [ +[ n ] ] [ -l ] [ -Pprinter ] [ job # ... ] [ user ...
     ]

DESCRIPTION
     _l_p_q examines the spooling area used by _l_p_d(8) for printing
     files on the line printer, and reports the status of the
     specified jobs or all jobs associated with a user. _l_p_q
     invoked without any arguments reports on any jobs currently
     in the queue.  A -P flag may be used to specify a particular
     printer, otherwise the default line printer is used (or the
     value of the PRINTER variable in the environment).  If a +
     argument is supplied, _l_p_q displays the spool queue until it
     empties.  Supplying a number immediately after the + sign
     indicates that _l_p_q should sleep _n seconds in between scans
     of the queue.  All other arguments supplied are interpreted
     as user names or job numbers to filter out only those jobs
     of interest.

     For each job submitted (i.e. invocation of _l_p_r(1)) _l_p_q
     reports the user's name, current rank in the queue, the
     names of files comprising the job, the job identifier (a
     number which may be supplied to _l_p_r_m(1) for removing a
     specific job), and the total size in bytes.  The -l option
     causes information about each of the files comprising the
     job to be printed.  Normally, only as much information as
     will fit on one line is displayed.  Job ordering is depen-
     dent on the algorithm used to scan the spooling directory
     and is supposed to be FIFO (First in First Out).  File names
     comprising a job may be unavailable (when _l_p_r(1) is used as
     a sink in a pipeline) in which case the file is indicated as
     ``(standard input)".

     If _l_p_q warns that there is no daemon present (i.e. due to
     some malfunction), the _l_p_c(8) command can be used to restart
     the printer daemon.

FILES
     /etc/termcap	     for manipulating the screen for repeated display
     /etc/printcap	     to determine printer characteristics
     /usr/spool/*	     the spooling directory, as determined from printcap
     /usr/spool/*/cf*	     control files specifying jobs
     /usr/spool/*/lock	     the lock file to obtain the currently active job

SEE ALSO
     lpr(1), lprm(1), lpc(8), lpd(8)

BUGS
     Due to the dynamic nature of the information in the spooling

     directory lpq may report unreliably.  Output formatting is
     sensitive to the line length of the terminal; this can
     results in widely spaced columns.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Unable to open various files.  The lock file being mal-
     formed.  Garbage files when there is no daemon active, but
     files in the spooling directory.
