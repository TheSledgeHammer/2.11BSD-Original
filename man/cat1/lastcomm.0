LASTCOMM(1)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	      LASTCOMM(1)



NAME
     lastcomm - show last commands executed in reverse order

SYNOPSIS
     lastcomm [ -f file ] [ command name ] ... [user name] ...
     [terminal name] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _L_a_s_t_c_o_m_m gives information on previously executed commands.

     Option:


     -f _f_i_l_e   Read from _f_i_l_e rather than the default accounting
	       file.

     With no arguments, _l_a_s_t_c_o_m_m prints information about all the
     commands recorded during the current accounting file's life-
     time.  If called with arguments, only accounting entries
     with a matching command name, user name, or terminal name
     are printed.  So, for example,

	  lastcomm a.out root ttyd0

     would produce a listing of all the executions of commands
     named _a._o_u_t by user _r_o_o_t on the terminal _t_t_y_d_0.

     For each process entry, the following are printed.

	  The name of the user who ran the process.
	  Flags, as accumulated by the accounting facilities in
	  the system.
	  The command name under which the process was called.
	  The amount of cpu time used by the process (in
	  seconds).
	  The time the process exited.

     The flags are encoded as follows: ``S'' indicates the com-
     mand was executed by the super-user, ``F'' indicates the
     command ran after a fork, but without a following _e_x_e_c,
     ``C'' indicates the command was run in PDP-11 compatibility
     mode (VAX only), ``D'' indicates the command terminated with
     the generation of a _c_o_r_e file, and ``X'' indicates the com-
     mand was terminated with a signal.

FILES
     /usr/adm/acct	 Default accounting file.
