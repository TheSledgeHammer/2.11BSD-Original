NAME
     pxref - Pascal cross-reference program

SYNOPSIS
     pxref [ - ] name

DESCRIPTION
     _P_x_r_e_f makes a line numbered listing and a cross-reference of
     identifier usage for the program in _n_a_m_e. The optional `-'
     argument suppresses the listing.  The keywords goto and
     label are treated as identifiers for the purpose of the
     cross-reference.  Include directives are not processed, but
     cause the placement of an entry indexed by `#include' in the
     cross-reference.
