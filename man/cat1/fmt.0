NAME
     fmt - simple text formatter

SYNOPSIS
     fmt [ name ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
     _F_m_t is a simple text formatter which reads the concatenation
     of input files (or standard input if none are given) and
     produces on standard output a version of its input with
     lines as close to 72 characters long as possible.	The spac-
     ing at the beginning of the input lines is preserved in the
     output, as are blank lines and interword spacing.

     _F_m_t is meant to format mail messages prior to sending, but
     may also be useful for other simple tasks.  For instance,
     within visual mode of the _e_x editor (e.g.	_v_i) the command
	  !}fmt
     will reformat a paragraph, evening the lines.

SEE ALSO
     nroff(1), mail(1)

BUGS
     The program was designed to be simple and fast - for more
     complex operations, the standard text processors are likely
     to be more appropriate.
