NAME
     tk - paginator for the Tektronix 4014

SYNOPSIS
     tk [ -t ] [ -_N ] [ -p_L ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
     The output of _t_k is intended for a Tektronix 4014 terminal.
     _T_k arranges for 66 lines to fit on the screen, divides the
     screen into _N columns, and contributes an eight space page
     offset in the (default) single-column case.  Tabs, spaces,
     and backspaces are collected and plotted when necessary.
     Teletype Model 37 half- and reverse-line sequences are
     interpreted and plotted.  At the end of each page _t_k waits
     for a newline (empty line) from the keyboard before continu-
     ing on to the next page.  In this wait state, the command
     !_c_o_m_m_a_n_d will send the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d to the shell.

     The command line options are:

     -t   Don't wait between pages; for directing output into a
	  file.

     -_N   Divide the screen into _N columns and wait after the
	  last column.

     -p_L  Set page length to _L lines.
