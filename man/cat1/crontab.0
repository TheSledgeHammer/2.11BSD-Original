NAME
     crontab - maintain crontab files for individual users (V3)

SYNOPSIS
     crontab [ -u user ] file
     crontab [ -u user ] { -l | -r | -e }

DESCRIPTION
     _C_r_o_n_t_a_b is the program used to install, deinstall or list
     the tables used to drive the _c_r_o_n(8) daemon in Vixie Cron.
     Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are
     files in /var, they are not intended to be edited directly.

     If the _a_l_l_o_w file exists, then you must be listed therein in
     order to be allowed to use this command.  If the _a_l_l_o_w file
     does not exist but the _d_e_n_y file does exist, then you must
     not be listed in the _d_e_n_y file in order to use this command.
     If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-
     dependent configuration parameters, only the super user will
     be allowed to use this command, or all users will be able to
     use this command.

     If the -_u option is given, it specifies the name of the user
     whose crontab is to be tweaked.  If this option is not
     given, _c_r_o_n_t_a_b examines "your" crontab, i.e., the crontab of
     the person executing the command.  Note that _s_u(8) can con-
     fuse _c_r_o_n_t_a_b and that if you are running inside of _s_u(8) you
     should always use the -_u option for safety's sake.

     The first form of this command is used to install a new
     crontab from some named file or standard input if the
     pseudo-filename ``-'' is given.

     The -_l option causes the current crontab to be displayed on
     standard output.

     The -_r option causes the current crontab to be removed.

     The -_e option is used to edit the current crontab using the
     editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment vari-
     ables.  After you exit from the editor, the modified crontab
     will be installed automatically.

     (``POSIX'').  This new command syntax differs from previous
     versions of Vixie Cron, as well as from the classic SVR3
     syntax.

DIAGNOSTICS
     A fairly informative usage message appears if you run it
     with a bad command line.
