NAME
     lprm - remove jobs from the line printer spooling queue

SYNOPSIS
     lprm [ -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r ] [ - ] [ job # ...  ] [ user ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
     _L_p_r_m will remove a job, or jobs, from a printer's spool
     queue.  Since the spooling directory is protected from
     users, using _l_p_r_m is normally the only method by which a
     user may remove a job.

     _L_p_r_m without any arguments will delete the currently active
     job if it is owned by the user who invoked _l_p_r_m.

     If the - flag is specified, _l_p_r_m will remove all jobs which
     a user owns.  If the super-user employs this flag, the spool
     queue will be emptied entirely. The owner is determined by
     the user's login name and host name on the machine where the
     _l_p_r command was invoked.

     Specifying a user's name, or list of user names, will cause
     _l_p_r_m to attempt to remove any jobs queued belonging to that
     user (or users).  This form of invoking _l_p_r_m is useful only
     to the super-user.

     A user may dequeue an individual job by specifying its job
     number.  This number may be obtained from the _l_p_q(1) pro-
     gram, e.g.

	  % lpq -l

	  1st: ken			     [job #013ucbarpa]
	       (standard input)              100 bytes
	  % lprm 13

     _L_p_r_m will announce the names of any files it removes and is
     silent if there are no jobs in the queue which match the
     request list.

     _L_p_r_m will kill off an active daemon, if necessary, before
     removing any spooling files.  If a daemon is killed, a new
     one is automatically restarted upon completion of file remo-
     vals.

     The -P option may be usd to specify the queue associated
     with a specific printer (otherwise the default printer, or
     the value of the PRINTER variable in the environment is
     used).

     /usr/spool/*	 spooling directories
     /usr/spool/*/lock	 lock file used to obtain the pid of the current
			 daemon and the job number of the currently active job

SEE ALSO
     lpr(1), lpq(1), lpd(8)

DIAGNOSTICS
     ``Permission denied" if the user tries to remove files other
     than his own.

BUGS
     Since there are race conditions possible in the update of
     the lock file, the currently active job may be incorrectly
     identified.
