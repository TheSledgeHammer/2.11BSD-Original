NAME
     checknr - check nroff/troff files

SYNOPSIS
     checknr [ -s ] [ -f ] [ -a.x1.y1.x2.y2. ... .xn.yn ] [
     -c.x1.x2.x3 ... .xn ] [ _f_i_l_e ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
     _C_h_e_c_k_n_r checks a list of _n_r_o_f_f(1) or _t_r_o_f_f(1) input files
     for certain kinds of errors involving mismatched opening and
     closing delimiters and unknown commands.  If no files are
     specified, _c_h_e_c_k_n_r checks the standard input.  Delimeters
     checked are:

     (1)  Font changes using \fx ... \fP.

     (2)  Size changes using \sx ... \s0.

     (3)  Macros that come in open ... close forms, for example,
	  the .TS and .TE macros which must always come in pairs.

     _C_h_e_c_k_n_r knows about the _m_s(7) and _m_e(7) macro packages.

     Additional pairs of macros can be added to the list using
     the -a option.  This must be followed by groups of six char-
     acters, each group defining a pair of macros.  The six char-
     acters are a period, the first macro name, another period,
     and the second macro name.  For example, to define a pair
     .BS and .ES, use -a.BS.ES

     The -c option defines commands which would otherwise be com-
     plained about as undefined.

     The -f option requests _c_h_e_c_k_n_r to ignore \f font changes.

     The -s option requests _c_h_e_c_k_n_r to ignore \s size changes.

     _C_h_e_c_k_n_r is intended to be used on documents that are
     prepared with _c_h_e_c_k_n_r in mind, much the same as _l_i_n_t. It
     expects a certain document writing style for \f and \s com-
     mands, in that each \fx must be terminated with \fP and each
     \sx must be terminated with \s0.  While it will work to
     directly go into the next font or explicitly specify the
     original font or point size, and many existing documents
     actually do this, such a practice will produce complaints
     from _c_h_e_c_k_n_r. Since it is probably better to use the \fP and
     \s0 forms anyway, you should think of this as a contribution
     to your document preparation style.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Complaints about unmatched delimiters.
     Complaints about unrecognized commands.
     Various complaints about the syntax of commands.

BUGS
     There is no way to define a 1 character macro name using -a.
     Does not correctly recognize certain reasonable constructs,
     such as conditionals.
