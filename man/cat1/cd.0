NAME
     cd - change working directory

SYNOPSIS
     cd directory

DESCRIPTION
     _D_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y becomes the new working directory.  The process
     must have execute (search) permission in _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

     Because a new process is created to execute each command, _c_d
     would be ineffective if it were written as a normal command.
     It is therefore recognized and executed by the shells.  In
     _c_s_h(1) you may specify a list of directories in which _d_i_r_e_c_-
     _t_o_r_y is to be sought as a subdirectory if it is not a sub-
     directory of the current directory; see the description of
     the _c_d_p_a_t_h variable in _c_s_h(1).
