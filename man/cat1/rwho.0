RWHO(1C)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual		 RWHO(1C)



NAME
     rwho - who's logged in on local machines

SYNOPSIS
     rwho [ -a ]

DESCRIPTION
     The _r_w_h_o command produces output similar to _w_h_o, but for all
     machines on the local network.  If no report has been
     received from a machine for 5 minutes then _r_w_h_o assumes the
     machine is down, and does not report users last known to be
     logged into that machine.

     If a users hasn't typed to the system for a minute or more,
     then _r_w_h_o reports this idle time.	If a user hasn't typed to
     the system for an hour or more, then the user will be omit-
     ted from the output of _r_w_h_o unless the -a flag is given.

FILES
     /usr/spool/rwho/whod.*   information about other machines

SEE ALSO
     ruptime(1C), rwhod(8C)

BUGS
     This is unwieldy when the number of machines on the local
     net is large.
