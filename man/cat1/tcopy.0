NAME
     tcopy - copy a mag tape

SYNOPSIS
     tcopy src [ dest ]

DESCRIPTION
     _T_c_o_p_y is designed to copy magnetic tapes.	The only assump-
     tion made about the tape is that there are two tape marks at
     the end.  _T_c_o_p_y with only a source tape specified will print
     information about the sizes of records and tape files.  If a
     destination is specified, then, a copy will be made of the
     source tape.  The blocking on the destination tape will be
     identical to that used on the source tape.  Copying a tape
     will yield the same output as if just printing the sizes.
