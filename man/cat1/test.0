NAME
     test - condition evaluation utility

SYNOPSIS
     test _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n

DESCRIPTION
     The _t_e_s_t utility evaluates the expression and, if it evalu-
     ates to true, returns a zero (true) exit status; otherwise
     it returns 1 (false).  If there is no expression, test also
     returns 1 (false).

     All operators and flags are separate arguments to the _t_e_s_t
     utility.

     The following primaries are used to construct expression:

      -b   _f_i_l_e
	  True if _f_i_l_e exists and is a block special file.

      -c   _f_i_l_e
	  True if _f_i_l_e exists and is a character special file.

      -d   _f_i_l_e
	  True if _f_i_l_e exists and is a directory.

      -e   _f_i_l_e
	  True if _f_i_l_e exists (regardless of type).

      -f   _f_i_l_e
	  True if _f_i_l_e exists and is a regular file.

      -g   _f_i_l_e
	  True if _f_i_l_e exists and its set group ID flag is set.

      -h   _f_i_l_e
	  True if _f_i_l_e exists and is a symbolic link.

      -n   _s_t_r_i_n_g
	  True if the length of _s_t_r_i_n_g is nonzero.

      -p   _f_i_l_e
	  True if _f_i_l_e is a named pipe

      -r   _f_i_l_e
	  True if _f_i_l_e exists and is readable.

      -s   _f_i_l_e
	  True if _f_i_l_e exists and has a size greater than zero.

      -t   [_f_i_l_e__d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_o_r]
	  True if the file whose file descriptor number is

	  _f_i_l_e__d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_o_r (default 1) is open and is associated
	  with a terminal.

      -u   _f_i_l_e
	  True if _f_i_l_e exists and its set user ID flag is set.

      -w   _f_i_l_e
	  True if _f_i_l_e exists and is writable.	True indicates
	  only that the write flag is on.  The file is not writ-
	  able on a read-only file system even if this test indi-
	  cates true.

      -x   _f_i_l_e
	  True if _f_i_l_e exists and is executable.  True indicates
	  only that the execute flag is on.  If _f_i_l_e is a direc-
	  tory, true indicates that _f_i_l_e can be searched.

      -z   _s_t_r_i_n_g
	  True if the length of _s_t_r_i_n_g is zero.

      _s_t_r_i_n_g
	  True if _s_t_r_i_n_g is not the null string.

      _s_1   =   _s_2
	  True if the strings _s_1 and _s_2 are identical.

      _s_1   !=	_s_2
	  True if the strings _s_1 and _s_2 are not identical.

      _n_1   -eq	 _n_2
	  True if the integers _n_1 and _n_2 are algebraically equal.

      _n_1   -ne	 _n_2
	  True if the integers _n_1 and _n_2 are not algebraically
	  equal.

      _n_1   -gt	 _n_2
	  True if the integer _n_1 is algebraically greater than
	  the integer _n_2 .

      _n_1   -ge	 _n_2
	  True if the integer _n_1 is algebraically greater than or
	  equal to the integer _n_2 .

      _n_1   -lt	 _n_2
	  True if the integer _n_1 is algebraically less than the
	  integer _n_2 .

      _n_1   -le	 _n_2
	  True if the integer _n_1 is algebraically less than or
	  equal to the integer _n_2 .

	  These primaries can be combined with the following opera-
	  tors:


     ! expression
	  True if _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n is false.

      _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_1   -a	 _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_2
	  True if both _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_1 and _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_2 are true.

      _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_1   -o	 _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_2
	  True if either _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_1 or _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_2 are true.

      (_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n)
	  True if expression is true.

	  The
	  -a operator has higher precedence than the -o operator.

GRAMMAR AMBIGUITY
     The test grammar is inherently ambiguous.	In order to
     assure a degree of consistency, the cases described in the
     IEEE Std 1003.2 ("POSIX"), section D11.2/4.62.4, standard
     are evaluated consistently according to the rules specified
     in the standards document.  All other cases are subject to
     the ambiguity in the command semantics.

RETURN VALUES
     The test utility exits with one of the following values:

     0	  expression evaluated to true.

     1	  expression evaluated to false or expression was miss-
	  ing.

     >1   An error occurred.

BUGS
     Named pipes are not implemented in 2.11BSD.

STANDARDS
     The test function is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2
     ("POSIX") compatible.
