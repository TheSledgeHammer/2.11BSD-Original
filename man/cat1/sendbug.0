NAME
     sendbug - mail a system bug report to 4bsd-bugs

SYNOPSIS
     sendbug [ address ]

DESCRIPTION
     Bug reports sent to `4bsd-bugs@Berkeley.EDU' are intercepted
     by a program which expects bug reports to conform to a stan-
     dard format.  _S_e_n_d_b_u_g is a shell script  to  help	the  user
     compose and mail bug reports in the correct format.  _S_e_n_d_b_u_g
     works by invoking the editor specified  by  the  environment
     variable _E_D_I_T_O_R on a temporary copy of the bug report format
     outline. The user must fill in the  appropriate  fields  and
     exit the editor.  The default editor is _v_i(1).  _S_e_n_d_b_u_g then
     mails the completed report  to  `4bsd-bugs@Berkeley.EDU'  or
     the address specified on the command line.

FILES
     /usr/ucb/bugformat       contains the bug report outline
