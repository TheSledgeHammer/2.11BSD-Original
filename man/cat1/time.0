NAME
     time - time a command

SYNOPSIS
     time command

DESCRIPTION
     The given command is executed; after it is complete, _t_i_m_e
     prints the elapsed time during the command, the time spent
     in the system, and the time spent in execution of the com-
     mand.  Times are reported in seconds.

     On a PDP-11, the execution time can depend on what kind of
     memory the program happens to land in; the user time in MOS
     is often half what it is in core.

     The times are printed on the diagnostic output stream.

     _T_i_m_e is built in to _c_s_h(1), using a different output format.

BUGS
     Elapsed time is accurate to the second, while the CPU times
     are measured to the 100th second.	Thus the sum of the CPU
     times can be up to a second larger than the elapsed time.

     _T_i_m_e is a built-in command to _c_s_h(1), with a much different
     syntax.  This command is available as ``/bin/time'' to _c_s_h
     users.
