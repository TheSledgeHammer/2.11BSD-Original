NAME
     whois - DARPA Internet user name directory service

SYNOPSIS
     whois name

DESCRIPTION
     whois help
	  Produces a helpful message similar to the following:

     Please enter a name or a handle (``ident"), such as ``Smith"
     or ``SRI-NIC".  Starting with a period forces a name-only
     search; starting with exclamation point forces handle-only.
     Examples:
	  Smith               [looks for name or handle SMITH	 ]
	  !SRI-NIC	      [looks for handle SRI-NIC only	 ]
	  .Smith, John	      [looks for name JOHN SMITH only	 ]
     Adding ``..." to the argument will match anything from that
     point, e.g. ``ZU..." will match ZUL, ZUM, etc.

     To have the ENTIRE membership list of a group or organiza-
     tion, if you are asking about a group or org, shown with the
     record, use an asterisk character `*' directly preceding the
     given argument.  [CAUTION: If there are a lot of members
     this will take a long time!] You may of course use exclama-
     tion point and asterisk, or a period and asterisk together.
