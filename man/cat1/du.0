NAME
     du - summarize disk usage

SYNOPSIS
     du [ -s ] [ -a ] [ name ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _D_u gives the number of kilobytes contained in all files and,
     recursively, directories within each specified directory or
     file _n_a_m_e.  If _n_a_m_e is missing, `.' is used.

     The argument -s causes only the grand total to be given.
     The argument -a causes an entry to be generated for each
     file.  Absence of either causes an entry to be generated for
     each directory only.

     A file which has two links to it is only counted once.

SEE ALSO
     df(1), quot(8)

BUGS
     Non-directories given as arguments (not under -a option) are
     not listed.
     If there are too many distinct linked files, _d_u counts the
     excess files multiply.
