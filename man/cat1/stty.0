NAME
     stty - set terminal options

SYNOPSIS
     stty [-a | -e] [-f _f_i_l_e] [operands]

DESCRIPTION
     _S_t_t_y sets certain I/O options on the current output termi-
     nal, placing its output on the diagnostic output.	With no
     argument, it reports the speed of the terminal and the set-
     tings of the options which are different from their
     defaults.

     The following options are available:

     -a        Display everything _s_t_t_y knows.  This has the same
	       effect as using the operand all or everything.
	       The distinction between all and everything has
	       been removed.

     -e        Same a -a above.

     -f        Open and use the terminal named by _f_i_l_e rather
	       than using standard output.  The file is opened
	       using the O_NONBLOCK flag of open(), making it
	       possible to set or display settings on a terminal
	       that might otherwise block on the open.

     The following operands are special:

     all	 Everything _s_t_t_y knows about is printed.

     everything  Same as all above.

     flushout	 Flush the queues for the device.  This is most
		 useful when an exiting process is stuck waiting
		 for terminal output to drain.

     speed	 The terminal speed alone is printed on the stan-
		 dard output.

     size	 The terminal (window) sizes are printed on the
		 standard output, first rows and then columns.

     _O_p_e_r_a_n_d_s are selected from the following:

     even      allow even parity input
     -even     disallow even parity input

     odd       allow odd parity input
     -odd      disallow odd parity input

     raw       raw mode input (no input processing (erase, kill,
	       interrupt, ...); parity bit passed back)
     -raw      negate raw mode

     cooked    same as `-raw'

     cbreak    make each character available to _r_e_a_d(2) as
	       received; no erase and kill processing, but all
	       other processing (interrupt, suspend, ...) is per-
	       formed
     -cbreak   make characters available to _r_e_a_d only when new-
	       line is received

     -nl       allow carriage return for new-line, and output
	       CR-LF for carriage return or new-line
     nl        accept only new-line to end lines

     echo      echo back every character typed
     -echo     do not echo characters

     tandem    enable inbound software (xon/xoff) flow control,
	       so that the system sends out the stop character
	       when its internal queue is in danger of overflow-
	       ing on input, and sends the start character when
	       it is ready to accept further input
     -tandem   disable inbound software (xon/xoff) flow control

     -tabs     replace tabs by spaces when printing
     tabs      preserve tabs

     For the following commands which take a character argument
     _c, you may also specify _c as ``undef'', to set the value to
     be undefined.  A value of ``^x'', a 2 character sequence, is
     also interpreted as a control character, with ``^?''
     representing delete.

     erase _c   set erase character to _c (default `#', but often
	       reset to ^H.)
     kill _c    set kill character to _c (default `@', but often
	       reset to ^U.)
     intr _c    set interrupt character to _c (default DEL or ^?
	       (delete), but often reset to ^C.)
     quit _c    set quit character to _c (default control \.)
     start _c   set start character to _c (default control Q.)
     stop _c    set stop character to _c (default control S.)
     eof _c     set end of file character to _c (default control
	       D.)
     brk _c     set break character to _c (default undefined.) This
	       character is an additional character causing
	       wakeup.
     dec       set all modes suitable for Digital Equipment Corp.

	       and ``newcrt''.)

	       Set terminal baud rate to the number given, if
	       possible.  (These are the speeds supported by the
	       DH-11 interface).

     rows _n    The terminal size is recorded as having _n rows.

     columns _n The terminal size is recorded as having _n columns.

     cols _n    is an alias for _c_o_l_u_m_n_s.

     A teletype driver which supports the job control processing
     of _c_s_h(1) and more functionality than the basic driver is
     fully described in _t_t_y(4).  The following options apply only
     to it.

     new       Use new driver (switching flushes typeahead).
     crt       Set options for a CRT (crtbs, ctlecho and, if >=
	       1200 baud, crterase and crtkill.)

     crtbs     Echo backspaces on erase characters.

     prterase  For printing terminal echo erased characters back-
	       wards within ``\'' and ``/''.

     crterase  Wipe out erased characters with ``backspace-
	       space-backspace.''
     -crterase Leave erased characters visible; just backspace.

     crtkill   Wipe out input on like kill ala crterase.
     -crtkill  Just echo line kill character and a newline on
	       line kill.

     ctlecho   Echo control characters as ``^_x'' (and delete as
	       ``^?''.) Print two backspaces following the EOT
	       character (control D).
     -ctlecho  Control characters echo as themselves; in cooked
	       mode EOT (control-D) is not echoed.

     decctlq   After output is suspended (normally by ^S), only a
	       start character (normally ^Q) will restart it.
	       This is compatible with DEC's vendor supplied sys-
	       tems.
     -decctlq  After output is suspended, any character typed
	       will restart it; the start character will restart
	       output without providing any input.  (This is the
	       default.)

     tostop    Background jobs stop if they attempt terminal out-
	       put.
     -tostop   Output from background jobs to the terminal is
	       allowed.

     flusho    Output is being discarded usually because user hit
	       control O (internal state bit).
     -flusho   Output is not being discarded.

     pendin    Input is pending after a switch from cbreak to
	       cooked and will be re-input when a read becomes
	       pending or more input arrives (internal state
	       bit).
     -pendin   Input is not pending.

     pass8     Passes all 8 bits through on input, in any mode.
     -pass8    Strips the 0200 bit on input except in raw mode.

     mdmbuf    Start/stop output on carrier transitions (not
	       implemented).
     -mdmbuf   Return error if write attempted after carrier
	       drops.

     litout    Send output characters without any processing.
     -litout   Do normal output processing, inserting delays,
	       etc.

     nohang    Don't send hangup signal if carrier drops.
     -nohang   Send hangup signal to control process group when
	       carrier drops.

     The following special characters are applicable only to the
     new teletype driver and are not normally changed.

     susp _c    set suspend process character to _c (default con-
	       trol Z).
     dsusp _c   set delayed suspend process character to _c
	       (default control Y).
     rprnt _c   set reprint line character to _c (default control
	       R).
     flush _c   set flush output character to _c (default control
	       O).
     werase _c  set word erase character to _c (default control W).
     lnext _c   set literal next character to _c (default control
	       V).

     Modem Control Status:

     These display the current state of modem control.	They are
     only displayed for actual tty lines and not for pseudo tty
     lines (more precisely, it is only displayed for lines which
     support the TIOCMGET ioctl.  See tty(4).

     While it is possible to change the state of the modem con-
     trol lines, the hardware or other software may prevent the
     change from actually taking place, or may cause the state to
     immediately revert to the original state.

     dcd (-dcd)     State of Data Carrier Detect.

     dsr (-dsr)     State of Data Set Ready.

     dtr (-dtr)     State of Data Terminal Ready.

     cts (-cts)     State of Clear To Send.

     rts (-rts)     State of Request To Send.
