NAME
     tsort - topological sort

SYNOPSIS
     tsort [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
     _T_s_o_r_t produces on the standard output a totally ordered list
     of items consistent with a partial ordering of items men-
     tioned in the input _f_i_l_e.	If no _f_i_l_e is specified, the
     standard input is understood.

     The input consists of pairs of items (nonempty strings)
     separated by blanks.  Pairs of different items indicate ord-
     ering.  Pairs of identical items indicate presence, but not
     ordering.

SEE ALSO
     lorder(1)

DIAGNOSTICS
     Odd data: there is an odd number of fields in the input
     file.

BUGS
     Uses a quadratic algorithm; not worth fixing for the typical
     use of ordering a library archive file.
