NAME
     install - install binaries

SYNOPSIS
     install [-cs] [-f _f_l_a_g_s] [-g _g_r_o_u_p] [-m _m_o_d_e] [-o _o_w_n_e_r]
     _f_i_l_e_1 _f_i_l_e_2

     install [-cs] [-f _f_l_a_g_s] [-g _g_r_o_u_p] [-m _m_o_d_e] [-o _o_w_n_e_r]
     _f_i_l_e_1 ... _f_i_l_e_N _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y

DESCRIPTION
     The file(s) are moved (or copied if the -c option is speci-
     fied) to the target file or directory.  If the destination
     is a directory, then the _f_i_l_e is moved into _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y with
     its original filename.  If the target file already exists,
     it is overwritten if permissions allow.

     -c      Copy the file.  This flag turns off the default
	     behavior of install where it deletes the original
	     file after creating the target.

     -f      Specify the target's file flags.  (See chflags(1)
	     for a list of possible flags and their meanings.)

     -g      Specify a group.

     -m      Specify an alternate mode.  The default mode is set
	     to rwxr-xr-x (0755).  The specified mode may be
	     either an octal or symbolic value; see chmod(1) for
	     a description of possible mode values.

     -o      Specify an owner.

     -s      Install exec's the command strip(1) to strip
	     binaries so that install can be portable over a
	     large number of systems and binary types.

     By default, install preserves all file flags, with the
     exception of the ``nodump'' flag.

     The install utility attempts to prevent moving a file onto
     itself.

     Installing /_d_e_v/_n_u_l_l creates an empty file.

     Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.  Other-
     wise, a value of 1 is returned.
