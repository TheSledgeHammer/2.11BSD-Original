NAME
     unifdef - remove ifdef'ed lines

SYNOPSIS
     unifdef [ -t -l -c -D_s_y_m -U_s_y_m -id_s_y_m -iu_s_y_m ] ...  [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
     _U_n_i_f_d_e_f is useful for removing ifdef'ed lines from a file
     while otherwise leaving the file alone.  _U_n_i_f_d_e_f is like a
     stripped-down C preprocessor: it is smart enough to deal
     with the nested ifdefs, comments, single and double quotes
     of C syntax so that it can do its job, but it doesn't do any
     including or interpretation of macros.  Neither does it
     strip out comments, though it recognizes and ignores them.
     You specify which symbols you want defined -D_s_y_m or unde-
     fined -U_s_y_m and the lines inside those ifdefs will be copied
     to the output or removed as appropriate.  The ifdef, ifndef,
     else, and endif lines associated with _s_y_m will also be
     removed.  Ifdefs involving symbols you don't specify are
     untouched and copied out along with their associated ifdef,
     else, and endif lines.  If an ifdef X occurs nested inside
     another ifdef X, then the inside ifdef is treated as if it
     were an unrecognized symbol.  If the same symbol appears in
     more than one argument, only the first occurrence is signi-
     ficant.

     The -l option causes _u_n_i_f_d_e_f to replace removed lines with
     blank lines instead of deleting them.

     If you use ifdefs to delimit non-C lines, such as comments
     or code which is under construction, then you must tell
     _u_n_i_f_d_e_f which symbols are used for that purpose so that it
     won't try to parse for quotes and comments in those ifdef'ed
     lines.  You specify that you want the lines inside certain
     ifdefs to be ignored but copied out with -id_s_y_m and -iu_s_y_m
     similar to -D_s_y_m and -U_s_y_m above.

     If you want to use _u_n_i_f_d_e_f for plain text (not C code), use
     the -t option.  This makes _u_n_i_f_d_e_f refrain from attempting
     to recognize comments and single and double quotes.

     _U_n_i_f_d_e_f copies its output to _s_t_d_o_u_t and will take its input
     from _s_t_d_i_n if no _f_i_l_e argument is given.  If the -c argument
     is specified, then the operation of _u_n_i_f_d_e_f is complemented,
     i.e. the lines that would have been removed or blanked are
     retained and vice versa.

     Exit status is 0 if output is exact copy of input, 1 if not,
     2 if trouble.

BUGS
     Does not know how to deal with _c_p_p consructs such as

	  #if  defined(X) || defined(Y)
