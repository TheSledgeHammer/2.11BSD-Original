NAME
     getnetent, getnetbyaddr, getnetbyname, setnetent, endnetent
     - get network entry

SYNOPSIS
     #include <netdb.h>

     struct netent *getnetent()

     struct netent *getnetbyname(name)
     char *name;

     struct netent *getnetbyaddr(net, type)
     long net;
     int type;

     setnetent(stayopen)
     int stayopen;

     endnetent()

DESCRIPTION
     _G_e_t_n_e_t_e_n_t, _g_e_t_n_e_t_b_y_n_a_m_e, and _g_e_t_n_e_t_b_y_a_d_d_r each return a
     pointer to an object with the following structure containing
     the broken-out fields of a line in the network data base,
     /_e_t_c/_n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s.

	  struct    netent {
	       char	 *n_name;  /* official name of net */
	       char	 **n_aliases;	/* alias list */
	       int	 n_addrtype;	/* net number type */
	       unsigned long  n_net;	     /* net number */
	  };

     The members of this structure are:

     n_name	 The official name of the network.

     n_aliases	 A zero terminated list of  alternate  names  for
		 the network.

     n_addrtype  The  type  of	the  network   number	returned;
		 currently only AF_INET.

     n_net	 The  network  number.	  Network   numbers   are
		 returned in machine byte order.

     _G_e_t_n_e_t_e_n_t reads the next line of the file, opening the  file
     if necessary.

     _S_e_t_n_e_t_e_n_t opens and rewinds the file.  If the _s_t_a_y_o_p_e_n  flag
     is non-zero, the net data base will not be closed after each

     call to _g_e_t_n_e_t_b_y_n_a_m_e or _g_e_t_n_e_t_b_y_a_d_d_r.

     _E_n_d_n_e_t_e_n_t closes the file.

     _G_e_t_n_e_t_b_y_n_a_m_e and _g_e_t_n_e_t_b_y_a_d_d_r sequentially search	from  the
     beginning	of  the  file  until  a  matching net name or net
     address and type is found,  or  until  EOF  is  encountered.
     Network numbers are supplied in host order.

FILES
     /etc/networks

SEE ALSO
     networks(5)

DIAGNOSTICS
     Null pointer (0) returned on EOF or error.

BUGS
     All information is contained in a static area so it must  be
     copied  if it is to be saved.  Only Internet network numbers
     are currently understood.	Expecting network numbers to  fit
     in no more than 32 bits is probably naive.
