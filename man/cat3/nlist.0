NLIST(3)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual		 NLIST(3)



NAME
     nlist - get entries from name list

SYNOPSIS
     #include <nlist.h>

     nlist(filename, nl)
     char *filename;
     struct nlist nl[];

DESCRIPTION
     _N_l_i_s_t examines the name list in the given executable output
     file and selectively extracts a list of values.  The name
     list consists of an array of structures containing names,
     types and values.	The list is terminated with a null name.
     Each name is looked up in the name list of the file.  If the
     name is found, the type and value of the name are inserted
     in the next two fields.  If the name is not found, both
     entries are set to 0.  See _a._o_u_t(5) for the structure
     declaration.

     This subroutine is useful for examining the system name list
     kept in the file /vmunix.	In this way programs can obtain
     system addresses that are up to date.

SEE ALSO
     a.out(5)

DIAGNOSTICS
     If the file cannot be found or if it is not a valid namelist
     -1 is returned; otherwise, the number of unfound namelist
     entries is returned.

     The type entry is set to 0 if the symbol is not found.
