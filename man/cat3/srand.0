NAME
     rand, srand - random number generator

SYNOPSIS
     srand(seed)
     int seed;

     rand()

DESCRIPTION
     The newer random(3) should be used in new applications; rand
     remains for compatibilty.

     _R_a_n_d uses a multiplicative congruential random number gen-
     erator with period 2**32 to return successive pseudo-random
     numbers in the range from 0 to (2**31)-1 on the VAX, and
     (2**15)-1 on the PDP-11.

     The generator is reinitialized by calling _s_r_a_n_d with 1 as
     argument.	It can be set to a random starting point by cal-
     ling _s_r_a_n_d with whatever you like as argument.
