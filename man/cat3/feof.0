NAME
     ferror, feof, clearerr, fileno - stream status inquiries

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>

     feof(stream)
     FILE *stream;

     ferror(stream)
     FILE *stream

     clearerr(stream)
     FILE *stream

     fileno(stream)
     FILE *stream;

DESCRIPTION
     _F_e_o_f returns non-zero when end of file is read on the named
     input _s_t_r_e_a_m, otherwise zero.  Unless cleared by _c_l_e_a_r_e_r_r,
     the end-of-file indication lasts until the stream is closed.

     _F_e_r_r_o_r returns non-zero when an error has occurred reading
     or writing the named _s_t_r_e_a_m, otherwise zero.  Unless cleared
     by _c_l_e_a_r_e_r_r, the error indication lasts until the stream is
     closed.

     _C_l_e_a_r_e_r_r resets the error and end-of-file indicators on the
     named _s_t_r_e_a_m.

     _F_i_l_e_n_o returns the integer file descriptor associated with
     the _s_t_r_e_a_m, see _o_p_e_n(2).

     Currently all of these functions are implemented as macros;
     they cannot be redeclared.
