NAME
     putc, putchar, fputc, putw - put character or word on a
     stream

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>

     int putc(c, stream)
     char c;
     FILE *stream;

     int putchar(c)

     int fputc(c, stream)
     FILE *stream;

     int putw(w, stream)
     FILE *stream;

DESCRIPTION
     _P_u_t_c appends the character _c to the named output _s_t_r_e_a_m.  It
     returns the character written.

     _P_u_t_c_h_a_r(_c) is defined as _p_u_t_c(_c, stdout).

     _F_p_u_t_c behaves like _p_u_t_c, but is a genuine function rather
     than a macro.

     _P_u_t_w appends word (that is, int) _w to the output _s_t_r_e_a_m.  It
     returns the word written.	_P_u_t_w neither assumes nor causes
     special alignment in the file.

SEE ALSO
     fopen(3S), fclose(3S), getc(3S), puts(3S), printf(3S),
     fread(3S)

DIAGNOSTICS
     These functions return the constant EOF upon error.  Since
     this is a good integer, _f_e_r_r_o_r(3S) should be used to detect
     _p_u_t_w errors.

BUGS
     Because it is implemented as a macro, _p_u_t_c treats a _s_t_r_e_a_m
     argument with side effects improperly.  In particular

     putc(c, *f++);

     doesn't work sensibly.

     Errors can occur long after the call to _p_u_t_c.
