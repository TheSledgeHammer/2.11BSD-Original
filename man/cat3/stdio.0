NAME
     stdio - standard buffered input/output package

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>

     FILE *stdin;
     FILE *stdout;
     FILE *stderr;

DESCRIPTION
     The functions described in section 3S constitute a user-
     level buffering scheme.  The in-line macros _g_e_t_c and
     _p_u_t_c(3S) handle characters quickly.  The higher level rou-
     tines _g_e_t_s, _f_g_e_t_s, _s_c_a_n_f, _f_s_c_a_n_f, _f_r_e_a_d, _p_u_t_s, _f_p_u_t_s,
     _p_r_i_n_t_f, _f_p_r_i_n_t_f, _f_w_r_i_t_e all use _g_e_t_c and _p_u_t_c; they can be
     freely intermixed.

     A file with associated buffering is called a _s_t_r_e_a_m, and is
     declared to be a pointer to a defined type FILE.  _F_o_p_e_n(3S)
     creates certain descriptive data for a stream and returns a
     pointer to designate the stream in all further transactions.
     There are three normally open streams with constant pointers
     declared in the include file and associated with the stan-
     dard open files:

     stdin     standard input file
     stdout    standard output file
     stderr    standard error file

     A constant `pointer' NULL (0) designates no stream at all.

     An integer constant EOF (-1) is returned upon end of file or
     error by integer functions that deal with streams.

     Any routine that uses the standard input/output package must
     include the header file <_s_t_d_i_o._h> of pertinent macro defini-
     tions.  The functions and constants mentioned in sections
     labeled 3S are declared in the include file and need no
     further declaration.  The constants, and the following
     `functions' are implemented as macros; redeclaration of
     these names is perilous: _g_e_t_c, _g_e_t_c_h_a_r, _p_u_t_c, _p_u_t_c_h_a_r, _f_e_o_f,
     _f_e_r_r_o_r, _f_i_l_e_n_o.

SEE ALSO
     open(2), close(2), read(2), write(2), fread(3S), fseek(3S),
     f*(3S)

DIAGNOSTICS
     The value EOF is returned uniformly to indicate that a FILE
     pointer has not been initialized with _f_o_p_e_n, input (output)
     has been attempted on an output (input) stream, or a FILE

     pointer designates corrupt or otherwise unintelligible FILE
     data.

     For purposes of efficiency, this implementation of the stan-
     dard library has been changed to line buffer output to a
     terminal by default and attempts to do this transparently by
     flushing the output whenever a _r_e_a_d(2) from the standard
     input is necessary.  This is almost always transparent, but
     may cause confusion or malfunctioning of programs which use
     standard i/o routines but use _r_e_a_d(2) themselves to read
     from the standard input.

     In cases where a large amount of computation is done after
     printing part of a line on an output terminal, it is neces-
     sary to _f_f_l_u_s_h(3S) the standard output before going off and
     computing so that the output will appear.

BUGS
     The standard buffered functions do not interact well with
     certain other library and system functions, especially _v_f_o_r_k
     and _a_b_o_r_t.
