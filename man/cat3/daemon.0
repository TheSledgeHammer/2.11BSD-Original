NAME
     daemon - run in the background

SYNOPSIS
     int
     daemon(nochdir, noclose)
	 int nochdir, noclose;

DESCRIPTION
     The daemon function is for programs wishing to detach them-
     selves from the controlling terminal and run in the back-
     ground as system daemons.

     Unless the argument _n_o_c_h_d_i_r is non-zero, daemon changes the
     current working directory to the root (``/'').

     Unless the argument _n_o_c_l_o_s_e is non-zero, daemon will
     redirect standard input, standard output and standard error
     to ``/dev/null''.

ERRORS
     The function daemon may fail and set _e_r_r_n_o for any of the
     errors specified for the library functions _f_o_r_k(2).

SEE ALSO
     fork(2), ioctl(2).

HISTORY
     The daemon function first appeared in 4.4BSD.
