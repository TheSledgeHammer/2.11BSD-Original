NAME
     l3tol, ltol3 - convert between 3-byte and long integers
     (2BSD)

SYNOPSIS
     l3tol(lp, cp, n)
     long *lp;
     char *cp;

     ltol3(cp, lp, n)
     char *cp;
     long *lp;

DESCRIPTION
     _L_3_t_o_l converts a list of _n three-byte integers packed into a
     character string pointed to by _c_p into a list of long
     integers pointed to by _l_p.

     _L_t_o_l_3 performs the inverse conversion from long integers
     (_l_p) to three-byte integers (_c_p).

     These functions are useful for file-system maintenance under
     2BSD where disk addresses within inodes are three bytes
     long.

SEE ALSO
     fs(5)

BUGS
     _l_3_t_o_l and _l_t_o_l_3 are unique to the PDP-11 and 2BSD; their use
     is discouraged.
