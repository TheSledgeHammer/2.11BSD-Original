NAME
     alarm - schedule signal after specified time

SYNOPSIS
     alarm(seconds)
     unsigned seconds;

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is made obsolete by setitimer(2).

     _A_l_a_r_m causes signal SIGALRM, see _s_i_g_v_e_c(2), to be sent to
     the invoking process in a number of seconds given by the
     argument.	Unless caught or ignored, the signal terminates
     the process.

     Alarm requests are not stacked; successive calls reset the
     alarm clock.  If the argument is 0, any alarm request is
     canceled.	Because of scheduling delays, resumption of exe-
     cution of when the signal is caught may be delayed an arbi-
     trary amount.  The longest specifiable delay time is
     2147483647 seconds.

     The return value is the amount of time previously remaining
     in the alarm clock.
