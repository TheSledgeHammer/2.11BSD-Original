NAME
     htonl, htons, ntohl, ntohs - convert values between host and
     network byte order

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <netinet/in.h>

     netlong = htonl(hostlong);
     u_long netlong, hostlong;

     netshort = htons(hostshort);
     u_short netshort, hostshort;

     hostlong = ntohl(netlong);
     u_long hostlong, netlong;

     hostshort = ntohs(netshort);
     u_short hostshort, netshort;

DESCRIPTION
     These routines convert 16 and 32 bit quantities between net-
     work byte order and host byte order.  On machines such as
     the SUN these routines are defined as null macros in the
     include file <_n_e_t_i_n_e_t/_i_n._h>.

     These routines are most often used in conjunction with
     Internet addresses and ports as returned by
     _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_n_a_m_e(3N) and _g_e_t_s_e_r_v_e_n_t(3N).

SEE ALSO
     gethostbyname(3N), getservent(3N)

BUGS
     The VAX handles bytes backwards from most everyone else in
     the world.  This is not expected to be fixed in the near
     future.
