NAME
     ungetc - push character back into input stream

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>

     ungetc(c, stream)
     FILE *stream;

DESCRIPTION
     _U_n_g_e_t_c pushes the character _c back on an input stream.  That
     character will be returned by the next _g_e_t_c call on that
     stream.  _U_n_g_e_t_c returns _c.

     One character of pushback is guaranteed provided something
     has been read from the stream and the stream is actually
     buffered.	Attempts to push EOF are rejected.

     _F_s_e_e_k(3S) erases all memory of pushed back characters.

SEE ALSO
     getc(3S), setbuf(3S), fseek(3S)

DIAGNOSTICS
     _U_n_g_e_t_c returns EOF if it can't push a character back.
