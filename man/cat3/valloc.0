NAME
     valloc - aligned memory allocator

SYNOPSIS
     char *valloc(size)
     unsigned size;

DESCRIPTION
     Valloc is obsoleted by the current version of malloc, which
     aligns page-sized and larger allocations.

     _V_a_l_l_o_c allocates _s_i_z_e bytes aligned on a page boundary.  It
     is implemented by calling _m_a_l_l_o_c(3) with a slightly larger
     request, saving the true beginning of the block allocated,
     and returning a properly aligned pointer.

DIAGNOSTICS
     _V_a_l_l_o_c returns a null pointer (0) if there is no available
     memory or if the arena has been detectably corrupted by
     storing outside the bounds of a block.

BUGS
     _V_f_r_e_e isn't implemented.
