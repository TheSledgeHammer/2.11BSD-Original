NAME
     strtok - string tokens

SYNOPSIS
     #include <string.h>

     char *
     strtok(str, sep)
     _c_h_a_r *_s_t_r;
     _c_h_a_r *_s_e_p;

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is obsoleted by strsep(3).

     The strtok() function is used to isolate sequential tokens
     in a null-terminated string, _s_t_r . These tokens are
     separated in the string by at least one of the characters in
     _s_e_p . The first time that strtok() is called, _s_t_r should be
     specified; subsequent calls, wishing to obtain further
     tokens from the same string, should pass a null pointer
     instead.  The separator string, _s_e_p , must be supplied each
     time, and may change between calls.

     The strtok() function returns a pointer to the beginning of
     each subsequent token in the string, after replacing the
     token itself with a NUL character.  When no more tokens
     remain, a null pointer is returned.

SEE ALSO
     index(3), memchr(3), rindex(3), strchr(3), strcspn(3),
     strpbrk(3), strrchr(3), strsep(3), strspn(3), strstr(3

STANDARDS
     The strtok() function conforms to ANSI C X3.159-1989 (``ANSI
     C'').

BUGS
     There is no way to get tokens from multiple strings simul-
     taneously.

     The System V strtok(), if handed a string containing only
     delimiter characters, will not alter the next starting
     point, so that a call to strtok() with a different (or
     empty) delimiter string may return a non-NULL value.  Since
     this implementation always alters the next starting point,
     such a sequence of calls would always return NULL.
