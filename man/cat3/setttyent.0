SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
     _G_e_t_t_t_y_e_n_t, and _g_e_t_t_t_y_n_a_m each return a pointer to an object
     with the following structure containing the broken-out
     fields of a line from the tty description file.

     ty_name	  is the name of the  character-special  file  in
		  the directory ``/dev".  For various reasons, it
		  must reside in the directory ``/dev".

     ty_getty	  is the  command  (usually  _g_e_t_t_y(8))	which  is
		  invoked  by _i_n_i_t to initialize tty line charac-
		  teristics.  In fact, any arbitrary command  can
		  be  used;  a	typical  use  is  to  initiate	a

		  terminal emulator in a window system.

     ty_type	  is the name of the default terminal  type  con-
		  nected  to  this  tty line. This is typically a
		  name	from  the  _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5)  data  base.    The
		  environment variable `TERM' is initialized with
		  this name by _g_e_t_t_y(8) or _l_o_g_i_n(1).

     ty_status	  is a mask of bit fields which indicate  various
		  actions  to  be  allowed  on this tty line. The
		  following is a description of each flag.

		  TTY_ON       Enables logins (i.e., _i_n_i_t(8) will
			       start  the specified ``getty" com-
			       mand on this entry).

		  TTY_SECURE   Allows root to login on this  ter-
			       minal.  Note that `TTY_ON' must be
			       included for this to be useful.

     ty_window	  is the command to execute for a  window  system
		  associated  with  the  line.	The window system
		  will be started before the command specified in
		  the  _t_y__g_e_t_t_y  entry	is  executed.  If none is
		  specified, this will be null.

     ty_comment   is the trailing comment field, if any; a  lead-
		  ing delimiter and white space will be removed.

     _G_e_t_t_t_y_e_n_t reads the next line from the  ttys  file,  opening
     the file if necessary; _s_e_t_t_t_y_e_n_t rewinds the file; _e_n_d_t_t_y_e_n_t
     closes it.

     _G_e_t_t_t_y_n_a_m searches from the beginning of the  file  until	a
     matching _n_a_m_e is found (or until EOF is encountered).

FILES
     /etc/ttys

SEE ALSO
     login(1),	ttyslot(3),  ttys(5),  gettytab(5),   termcap(5),

DIAGNOSTICS
     Null pointer (0) returned on EOF or error.

BUGS
     All information is contained in a static area so it must  be
     copied if it is to be saved.
