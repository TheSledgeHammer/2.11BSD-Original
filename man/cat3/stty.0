NAME
     stty, gtty - set and get terminal state (defunct)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sgtty.h>

     stty(fd, buf)
     int fd;
     struct sgttyb *buf;

     gtty(fd, buf)
     int fd;
     struct sgttyb *buf;

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is obsoleted by ioctl(2).

     _S_t_t_y sets the state of the terminal associated with _f_d.
     _G_t_t_y retrieves the state of the terminal associated with _f_d.
     To set the state of a terminal the call must have write per-
     mission.

     The _s_t_t_y call is actually ``ioctl(fd, TIOCSETP, buf)'',
     while the _g_t_t_y call is ``ioctl(fd, TIOCGETP, buf)''.  See
     _i_o_c_t_l(2) and _t_t_y(4) for an explanation.

DIAGNOSTICS
     If the call is successful 0 is returned, otherwise -1 is
     returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o contains the reason
     for the failure.
