NAME
     getgrent, getgrgid, getgrnam, setgrent, endgrent - get group
     file entry

SYNOPSIS
     #include <grp.h>

     struct group *getgrent()

     struct group *getgrgid(gid)
     int gid;

     struct group *getgrnam(name)
     char *name;

     setgrent()

     endgrent()

DESCRIPTION
     _G_e_t_g_r_e_n_t, _g_e_t_g_r_g_i_d and _g_e_t_g_r_n_a_m each return pointers to an
     object with the following structure containing the broken-
     out fields of a line in the group file.

	  /*   grp.h	 4.1  83/05/03	*/

	  struct    group { /* see getgrent(3) */
	       char *gr_name;
	       char *gr_passwd;
	       int  gr_gid;
	       char **gr_mem;
	  };

	  struct group *getgrent(), *getgrgid(), *getgrnam();

     The members of this structure are:

     gr_name	The name of the group.
     gr_passwd	The encrypted password of the group.
     gr_gid	The numerical group-ID.
     gr_mem	Null-terminated vector of pointers to the indivi-
		dual member names.

     _G_e_t_g_r_e_n_t simply reads the next line while _g_e_t_g_r_g_i_d and _g_e_t_-
     _g_r_n_a_m search until a matching _g_i_d or _n_a_m_e is found (or until
     EOF is encountered).  Each routine picks up where the others
     leave off so successive calls may be used to search the
     entire file.

     A call to _s_e_t_g_r_e_n_t has the effect of rewinding the group
     file to allow repeated searches.  _E_n_d_g_r_e_n_t may be called to
     close the group file when processing is complete.
