NAME
     initgroups - initialize group access list

SYNOPSIS
     initgroups(name, basegid)
     char *name;
     int basegid;

DESCRIPTION
     _I_n_i_t_g_r_o_u_p_s reads through the group file and sets up, using
     the _s_e_t_g_r_o_u_p_s(2) call, the group access list for the user
     specified in _n_a_m_e.  The _b_a_s_e_g_i_d is automatically included in
     the groups list.  Typically this value is given as the group
     number from the password file.

FILES
     /etc/group

SEE ALSO
     setgroups(2)

DIAGNOSTICS
     _I_n_i_t_g_r_o_u_p_s returns -1 if it was not invoked by the super-
     user.

BUGS
     _I_n_i_t_g_r_o_u_p_s uses the routines based on _g_e_t_g_r_e_n_t(3).  If the
     invoking program uses any of these routines, the group
     structure will be overwritten in the call to _i_n_i_t_g_r_o_u_p_s.
