NAME
     psignal, sys_siglist - system signal messages

SYNOPSIS
     psignal(sig, s)
     unsigned sig;
     char *s;

     char *sys_siglist[];

DESCRIPTION
     _P_s_i_g_n_a_l produces a short message on the standard error file
     describing the indicated signal.  First the argument string
     _s is printed, then a colon, then the name of the signal and
     a new-line.  Most usefully, the argument string is the name
     of the program which incurred the signal.	The signal number
     should be from among those found in <_s_i_g_n_a_l._h>.

     To simplify variant formatting of signal names, the vector
     of message strings _s_y_s__s_i_g_l_i_s_t is provided; the signal
     number can be used as an index in this table to get the sig-
     nal name without the newline.  The define NSIG defined in
     <_s_i_g_n_a_l._h> is the number of messages provided for in the
     table; it should be checked because new signals may be added
     to the system before they are added to the table.
