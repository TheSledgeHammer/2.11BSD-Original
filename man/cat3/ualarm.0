NAME
     ualarm - schedule signal after specified time

SYNOPSIS
     unsigned ualarm(value, interval)
     unsigned value;
     unsigned interval;

DESCRIPTION
     This is a simplified interface to setitimer(2).

     _U_a_l_a_r_m causes signal SIGALRM, see _s_i_g_n_a_l(3C), to be sent to
     the invoking process in a number of microseconds given by
     the _v_a_l_u_e argument.  Unless caught or ignored, the signal
     terminates the process.

     If the _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l argument is non-zero, the SIGALRM signal
     will be sent to the process every _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l microseconds
     after the timer expires (e.g. after _v_a_l_u_e microseconds have
     passed).

     Because of scheduling delays, resumption of execution of
     when the signal is caught may be delayed an arbitrary
     amount.  The longest specifiable delay time (on the vax) is
     2147483647 microseconds.

     The return value is the amount of time previously remaining
     in the alarm clock.

     signal(3C), sleep(3), alarm(3), usleep(3)

NOTES  (PDP-11)
     On the PDP-11, _s_e_t_i_t_i_m_e_r(2) rounds the number of
     microseconds up to seconds resolution, therefore _u_a_l_a_r_m
     doesn't give you any more resolution than _a_l_a_r_m(3).
