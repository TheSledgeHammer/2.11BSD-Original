FCLOSE(3S)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       FCLOSE(3S)



NAME
     fclose, fflush - close or flush a stream

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>

     fclose(stream)
     FILE *stream;

     fflush(stream)
     FILE *stream;

DESCRIPTION
     _F_c_l_o_s_e causes any buffers for the named _s_t_r_e_a_m to be emp-
     tied, and the file to be closed.  Buffers allocated by the
     standard input/output system are freed.

     _F_c_l_o_s_e is performed automatically upon calling _e_x_i_t(3).

     _F_f_l_u_s_h causes any buffered data for the named output _s_t_r_e_a_m
     to be written to that file.  The stream remains open.

SEE ALSO
     close(2), fopen(3S), setbuf(3S)

DIAGNOSTICS
     These routines return EOF if _s_t_r_e_a_m is not associated with
     an output file, or if buffered data cannot be transferred to
     that file.
