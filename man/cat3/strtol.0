NAME
     strtol - convert string value to a long

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdlib.h>
     #include <limits.h>

     long
     strtol(nptr, endptr, base)
     _c_h_a_r *_n_p_t_r;
     _c_h_a_r **_e_n_d_p_t_r;
     _i_n_t _b_a_s_e;

DESCRIPTION
     The strtol() function converts the string in _n_p_t_r to a _l_o_n_g
     value.  The conversion is done according to the given _b_a_s_e,
     which must be between 2 and 36 inclusive, or be the special
     value 0.

     The string may begin with an arbitrary amount of white space
     (as determined by isspace(3)) followed by a single optional
     `+' or `-' sign.  If _b_a_s_e is zero or 16, the string may then
     include a `0x' prefix, and the number will be read in base
     16; otherwise, a zero _b_a_s_e is taken as 10 (decimal) unless
     the next character is `0', in which case it is taken as 8
     (octal).

     The remainder of the string is converted to a _l_o_n_g value in
     the obvious manner, stopping at the first character which is
     not a valid digit in the given base.  (In bases above 10,
     the letter `A' in either upper or lower case represents 10,
     `B' represents 11, and so forth, with `Z' representing 35.)

     If _e_n_d_p_t_r is non nil, strtol() stores the address of the
     first invalid character in *_e_n_d_p_t_r . If there were no digits
     at all, however, strtol() stores the original value of _n_p_t_r
     in *_e_n_d_p_t_r.  (Thus, if *_n_p_t_r is not `\0' but **_e_n_d_p_t_r is
     `\0' on return, the entire string was valid.)

RETURN VALUES
     The strtol() function returns the result of the conversion,
     unless the value would underflow or overflow.  If an under-
     flow occurs, strtol() returns LONG_MIN.  If an overflow
     occurs, strtol() returns LONG_MAX.  In both cases, errno is
     set to ERANGE .

ERRORS
     [ERANGE]	    The given string was out of range; the value
		    converted has been clamped.
