NAME
     ns_addr, ns_ntoa - Xerox NS(tm)  address conversion routines

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <netns/ns.h>

     struct ns_addr ns_addr(cp)
     char *cp;

     char *ns_ntoa(ns)
     struct ns_addr ns;

DESCRIPTION
     The routine _n_s__a_d_d_r interprets character strings represent-
     ing XNS addresses, returning binary information suitable for
     use in system calls.  _n_s__n_t_o_a takes XNS addresses and
     returns ASCII strings representing the address in a notation
     in common use in the Xerox Development Environment:
	  <network number>.<host number>.<port number>
     Trailing zero fields are suppressed, and each number is
     printed in hexadecimal, in a format suitable for input to
     _n_s__a_d_d_r.  Any fields lacking super-decimal digits will have
     a trailing ``H'' appended.

     Unfortunately, no universal standard exists for representing
     XNS addresses.  An effort has been made to insure that
     _n_s__a_d_d_r be compatible with most formats in common use.  It
     will first separate an address into 1 to 3 fields using a
     single delimiter chosen from period (``.''), colon (``:'')
     or pound-sign (``#'').  Each field is then examined for byte
     separators (colon or period).  If there are byte separators,
     each subfield separated is taken to be a small hexadecimal
     number, and the entirety is taken as a network-byte-ordered
     quantity to be zero extended in the high-network-order
     bytes.  Next, the field is inspected for hyphens, in which
     case the field is assumed to be a number in decimal notation
     with hyphens separating the millenia.  Next, the field is
     assumed to be a number: It is interpreted as hexadecimal if
     there is a leading ``0x'' (as in C), a trailing ``H'' (as in
     Mesa), or there are any super-decimal digits present.  It is
     interpreted as octal is there is a leading ``0'' and there
     are no super-octal digits.  Otherwise, it is converted as a
     decimal number.

BUGS
     The string returned by _n_s__n_t_o_a resides in a static memory
     area.
     _n_s__a_d_d_r should diagnose improperly formed input, and there
     should be an unambiguous way to recognize this.
