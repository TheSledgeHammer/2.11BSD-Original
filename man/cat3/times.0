NAME
     times - get process times

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/times.h>

     times(buffer)
     struct tms *buffer;

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is obsoleted by getrusage(2).

     _T_i_m_e_s returns time-accounting information for the current
     process and for the terminated child processes of the
     current process.  All times are in 1/HZ seconds, where HZ is
     60.

     This is the structure returned by _t_i_m_e_s:

     /*
      * Structure returned by times()
      */
     struct tms {
	  time_t    tms_utime;		/* user time */
	  time_t    tms_stime;		/* system time */
	  time_t    tms_cutime;         /* user time, children */
	  time_t    tms_cstime;         /* system time, children */
     };

     The children times are the sum of the children's process
     times and their children's times.
