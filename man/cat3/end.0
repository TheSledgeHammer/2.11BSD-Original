NAME
     end, etext, edata - last locations in program

SYNOPSIS
     extern end;
     extern etext;
     extern edata;

DESCRIPTION
     These names refer neither to routines nor to locations with
     interesting contents.  The address of _e_t_e_x_t is the first
     address above the program text, _e_d_a_t_a above the initialized
     data region, and _e_n_d above the uninitialized data region.

     When execution begins, the program break coincides with _e_n_d,
     but it is reset by the routines _b_r_k(2), _m_a_l_l_o_c(3), standard
     input/output (_s_t_d_i_o(3S)), the profile (-p) option of _c_c(1),
     etc.  The current value of the program break is reliably
     returned by `sbrk(0)', see _b_r_k(2).
