SETRUID(3)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       SETRUID(3)



NAME
     setruid, setrgid - set user and group ID

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     _i_n_t
     setruid(ruid)
	 uid_t ruid

     _i_n_t
     setrgid(rgid)
	 gid_t rgid

DESCRIPTION
     The setruid function (setrgid) sets the real user ID (group
     ID) of the current process.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon success, these functions return 0; otherwise -1 is
     returned.

     If the user is not the super user, or the uid specified is
     not the real or effective ID, these functions return -1.

     The use of these calls is not portable.  Their use is
     discouraged; they will be removed in the future.

SEE ALSO
     setuid(2), setgid(2), seteuid(2), setegid(2), getuid(2),
     getgid(2)

HISTORY
     The setruid and setrgid syscalls appeared in 4.2BSD and were
     dropped in 4.4BSD.
