NAME
     strftime - format date and time

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <time.h>
     #include <string.h>

     size_t strftime(buf, maxsize, format, timeptr)
     char *buf;
     size_t maxsize;
     char *format;
     struct tm *timeptr;

DESCRIPTION
     The strftime() function formats the information from _t_i_m_e_p_t_r
     into the buffer _b_u_f according to the string pointed to by
     _f_o_r_m_a_t.

     The _f_o_r_m_a_t string consists of zero or more conversion
     specifications and ordinary characters.  All ordinary char-
     acters are copied directly into the buffer.  A conversion
     specification consists of a percent sign ``%'' and one other
     character.

     No more than _m_a_x_s_i_z_e characters will be placed into the
     array.  If the total number of resulting characters, includ-
     ing the terminating null character, is not more than _m_a_x_-
     _s_i_z_e, strftime() returns the number of characters in the
     array, not counting the terminating null.	Otherwise, zero
     is returned.

     Each conversion specification is replaced by the characters
     as follows which are then copied into the buffer.

     %A     is replaced by the full weekday name.

     %a     is replaced by the abbreviated weekday name, where
	    the abbreviation is the first three characters.

     %B     is replaced by the full month name.

     %b or %h
	    is replaced by the abbreviated month name, where the
	    abbreviation is the first three characters.

     %C  is equivalent to ``%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Y'' (the format
	 produced by _a_s_c_t_i_m_e(3)).

     %c     is equivalent to ``%m/%d/%y''.

     %D     is replaced by the date in the format ``mm/dd/yy''.
