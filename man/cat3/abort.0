NAME
     abort - generate a fault

DESCRIPTION
     _A_b_o_r_t executes an instruction which is illegal in user mode.
     This causes a signal that normally terminates the process
     with a core dump, which may be used for debugging.

SEE ALSO
     adb(1), sigvec(2), exit(2)

DIAGNOSTICS
     Usually ``Illegal instruction - core dumped'' from the
     shell.

BUGS
     The abort() function does not flush standard I/O buffers.
     Use _f_f_l_u_s_h(3S).
