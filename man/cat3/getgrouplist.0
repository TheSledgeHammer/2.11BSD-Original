NAME
     getgrouplist - calculate group access list

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>
     int
     getgrouplist(_n_a_m_e, _b_a_s_e_g_i_d, _g_r_o_u_p_s, _n_g_r_o_u_p_s)
		  char	*name;
		  gid_t basegid;
		  gid_t *groups;
		  int	*ngroups;

DESCRIPTION
     The getgrouplist function reads through the group file and
     calculates the group access list for the user specified in
     _n_a_m_e.  The _b_a_s_e_g_i_d is automatically included in the groups
     list.  Typically this value is given as the group number
     from the password file.

     The resulting group list is returned in the integer array
     pointed to by _g_r_o_u_p_s.  The caller specifies the size of the
     _g_r_o_u_p_s array in the integer pointed to by _n_g_r_o_u_p_s; the
     actual number of groups found is returned in _n_g_r_o_u_p_s.

RETURN VALUES
     The getgrouplist function returns -1 if the size of the
     group list is too small to hold all the user's groups.
     Here, the group array will be filled with as many groups as
     will fit.

FILES
     /etc/group  group membership list

SEE ALSO
     setgroups(2), initgroups(3)

HISTORY
     The getgrouplist function first appeared in 4.4BSD.

BUGS
     The getgrouplist function uses the routines based on get-
     grent(3).	If the invoking program uses any of these rou-
     tines, the group structure will be overwritten in the call
     to getgrouplist.
