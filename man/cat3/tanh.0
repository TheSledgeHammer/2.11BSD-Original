NAME
     sinh, cosh, tanh - hyperbolic functions

SYNOPSIS
     #include <math.h>

     double sinh(x)
     double x;

     double cosh(x)
     double x;

     double tanh(x)
     double x;

DESCRIPTION
     These functions compute the designated hyperbolic functions
     for real arguments.

ERROR (due to Roundoff etc.)
     Below 2.4 _u_l_ps; an _u_l_p is one _Unit in the _Last _Place.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Sinh and cosh return the reserved operand on a VAX if the
     correct value would overflow.
