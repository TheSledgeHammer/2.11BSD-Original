NAME
     getloadavg - get system load averages

SYNOPSIS
     getloadavg(loadavg, nelem)
	    double loadavg[];
	    int    nelem;

DESCRIPTION
     The _g_e_t_l_o_a_d_a_v_g function returns the number of processes in
     the system run queue averaged over various periods of time.
     Up to _n_e_l_e_m samples are retrieved and assigned to successive
     elements of _l_o_a_d_a_v_g.  The system imposes a maximum of 3 sam-
     ples, representing averages over the last 1, 5, and 15
     minutes, respectively.

DIAGNOSTICS
     If the load average was unobtainable, -1 is returned; other-
     wise, the number of samples actually retrieved is returned.

SEE ALSO
     uptime(1), sysctl(3), sysctl(8).

HISTORY
     The getloadavg function appeared in 4.3BSD-Reno.

     This function replaces the 2.9BSD compatibility routine
     getla().
