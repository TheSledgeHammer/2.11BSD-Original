NAME
     utime - set file times

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>

     utime(file, timep)
     char *file;
     time_t timep[2];

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is obsoleted by utimes(2).

     The _u_t_i_m_e call uses the `accessed' and `updated' times in
     that order from the _t_i_m_e_p vector to set the corresponding
     recorded times for _f_i_l_e.

     The caller must be the owner of the file or the super-user.
     The `inode-changed' time of the file is set to the current
     time.
