NAME
     time, ftime - get date and time

SYNOPSIS
     long time(0)

     long time(tloc)
     long *tloc;

     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/timeb.h>
     ftime(tp)
     struct timeb *tp;

DESCRIPTION
     These interfaces are obsoleted by gettimeofday(2).

     _T_i_m_e returns the time since 00:00:00 GMT, Jan. 1, 1970,
     measured in seconds.

     If _t_l_o_c is nonnull, the return value is also stored in the
     place to which _t_l_o_c points.

     The _f_t_i_m_e entry fills in a structure pointed to by its argu-
     ment, as defined by <_s_y_s/_t_i_m_e_b._h>:

     /*
      * Structure returned by ftime system call
      */
     struct timeb
     {
	  time_t   time;
	  unsigned short millitm;
	  short    timezone;
	  short    dstflag;
     };

     The structure contains the time since the epoch in seconds,
     up to 1000 milliseconds of more-precise interval, the local
     time zone (measured in minutes of time westward from
     Greenwich), and a flag that, if nonzero, indicates that Day-
     light Saving time applies locally during the appropriate
     part of the year.
