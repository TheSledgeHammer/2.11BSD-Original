GETUSERSHELL(3)     UNIX Programmer's Manual	  GETUSERSHELL(3)



NAME
     getusershell, setusershell, endusershell - get legal user
     shells

SYNOPSIS
     char *getusershell()

     setusershell()

     endusershell()

DESCRIPTION
     _G_e_t_u_s_e_r_s_h_e_l_l returns a pointer to a legal user shell as
     defined by the system manager in the file /_e_t_c/_s_h_e_l_l_s.  If
     /_e_t_c/_s_h_e_l_l_s is unreadable or does not exist, _g_e_t_u_s_e_r_s_h_e_l_l
     behaves as if /_b_i_n/_s_h and /_b_i_n/_c_s_h were listed in the file.

     _G_e_t_u_s_e_r_s_h_e_l_l reads the next line (opening the file if neces-
     sary); _s_e_t_u_s_e_r_s_h_e_l_l rewinds the file; _e_n_d_u_s_e_r_s_h_e_l_l closes
     it.

FILES
     /etc/shells

SEE ALSO
     shells(5)

DIAGNOSTICS
     The routine _g_e_t_u_s_e_r_s_h_e_l_l returns a null pointer (0) on EOF.

BUGS
     All information is contained in a static area so it must be
     copied if it is to be saved.
