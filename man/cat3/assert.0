ASSERT(3)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual		ASSERT(3)



NAME
     assert - program verification

SYNOPSIS
     #include <assert.h>

     assert(expression)

DESCRIPTION
     _A_s_s_e_r_t is a macro that indicates _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n is expected to
     be true at this point in the program.  It causes an _e_x_i_t(2)
     with a diagnostic comment on the standard output when
     _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n is false (0).  Compiling with the _c_c(1) option
     -DNDEBUG effectively deletes _a_s_s_e_r_t from the program.

DIAGNOSTICS
     `Assertion failed: file _f line _n.' _F is the source file and
     _n the source line number of the _a_s_s_e_r_t statement.
